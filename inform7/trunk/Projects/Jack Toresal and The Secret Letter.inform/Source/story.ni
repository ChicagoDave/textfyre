Part 3 - Properties of Tables

To say random entry of (t - a table-name):
	choose a random row in t;
	say "[text entry]". 

Part 4 - Properties of Objects

Chapter 1 - Proximity

Definition: a thing is nearby:
	if it is in the location then decide yes;
	decide no.

Chapter 2 - Automatic doors

Implicitly opening something is an activity.

Before going through a closed door (called the obstacle):
	carry out the implicitly opening activity with the obstacle;
	if the obstacle is closed, stop the action;

Rule for implicitly opening something (called the unopened item):
	say "(first opening [the unopened item])[command clarification break]";
	try silently opening the unopened item; 

Part 5 - Loitering and waiting around

[ This tracks the number of turns a player has remained in the same location ]

The last room is a room which varies.
The waiting count is a number variable.

The waiting around rule is listed first in the every turn rules.

Every turn (this is the waiting around rule):
	if the location is the same location as last time begin;
		stay put;
	otherwise;
		change the waiting count to zero;
	end if;

The last every turn rule:
	change the last room to the location;

Definition: a room is the same location as last time if it is the last room.
Definition: a person is on the move if the location is not the same location as last time.

To stay put:
	increment the waiting count by 1;

Part 6 - Conversation

Chapter 1 - Communicating and other-than-communicating

Telling someone about something is communicating. Asking someone about something is communicating. Asking someone for something is communicating. Answering someone that something is communicating. Talking to someone is communicating.

[ The following big definition exists only because we can't do "Instead of doing something other than communicating," and it really seems to be the easiest way to achieve the same effect: see Example 174, "Under Contract", in section 12.11 of the manual.]

Taking is other-than-communicating. Removing something from is other-than-communicating. Dropping is other-than-communicating. Putting something on is other-than-communicating. Inserting something into is other-than-communicating. Eating is other-than-communicating. Going is other-than-communicating. Entering is other-than-communicating. Exiting is other-than-communicating. Getting off is other-than-communicating. Looking under is other-than-communicating. Searching is other-than-communicating. Locking something with is other-than-communicating. Unlocking something with is other-than-communicating. Switching on is other-than-communicating. Switching off is other-than-communicating. Opening is other-than-communicating. Closing is other-than-communicating. Wearing is other-than-communicating. Taking off is other-than-communicating. Touching is other-than-communicating. Waving is other-than-communicating. Pulling is other-than-communicating. Pushing is other-than-communicating. Turning is other-than-communicating. Pushing something to is other-than-communicating. Burning is other-than-communicating. Tasting is other-than-communicating. Cutting is other-than-communicating. Jumping is other-than-communicating. Tying something to is other-than-communicating. Swinging is other-than-communicating. Rubbing is other-than-communicating. Buying is other-than-communicating. Climbing is other-than-communicating. 

Chapter 2 - Listening while having a conversation

[This allows you to e.g. "LISTEN TO BOBBY" as a way to reiterate the conversation menu.]

Instead of listening to a person while the noun is the current conversationalist:
	display the menu;

Chapter 3 - Error Message for Ask/Tell

[Since all dialogue is handled by TALK TO PERSON and then choosing menu options, we need to head off attempts to ASK/TELL PERSON ABOUT and other standard communication actions, so that the player doesn't get lame error messages.]

Understand the command "answer", "say", "shout", "speak" as something new. Understand the command "tell" as something new. Understand the command "ask" as something new.

Understand "answer [text]" as a mistake ("[just talk].").
Understand "answer [text] to/at [someone]" as a mistake ("[just talk]."). Understand the commands "say", "shout", "speak" as something new.
Understand "ask [someone] about/for [text]" as a mistake ("[just talk].").
Understand "tell [someone] about [text]" as a mistake ("[just talk].").

Before asking someone to try doing something:
	instead say "[just talk]."

To say just talk:
	say "To talk to a person, simply type TALK TO (whomever)".

Part 9 - Spooling through dialogue

[ A generalisation of scripted dialogue. ]

To spool through dialogue in (t - a table-name):
	repeat through t begin;
		say "[text entry][no line break]";
		blank out the whole row;
		rule succeeds;
	end repeat.

Part 10 - Looking through

[Look through usually generates the "search" action, as in "look through pile of books." But mostly in this game we want to "look through the arrow slit" or "look through the viewing window"... ]

Looking through is an action applying to one visible thing.
Understand "look through [door]" as looking through.
Understand "look through [container]" as looking through.
[ ...And anything else is "search" as normal. ]

Carry out looking through:
	try examining the noun instead.

Part 12 - One shot texts

[Adapted from the manual. Say [first time]some text[subsequently]some other, optional text[only]. ]

To say first time -- beginning say_first_time: 
    (- {-allocate-storage:say_first_time}if (I7_ST_say_first_time-->{-counter:say_first_time} == false) {-open-brace} I7_ST_say_first_time-->{-advance-counter:say_first_time} = true; -). 
To say subsequently -- continuing say_first_time:
    (- {-close-brace} else {-open-brace} -).
To say only -- ending say_first_time: 
    (- {-close-brace} -). 

Part 13 - HTMLesque Informese

[105 "[italic type]...[roman type]"s later, I finally cracked.

Even these are not perfectly straightforward to use. If printing a dot immediately before a text substitution, Inform sees fit to add a line break. So there are quite a few "...[no line break][i]some text[r]" constructions. ]

To say i:
	say italic type;

To say r:
	say roman type;

To say b:
	say bold type;

Part 14 - The time of day

[It's becoming apparent that scenes are awkward to work with beyond the most simple applications. Keeping track of whether it's day or night according to which scenes are currently running is doomed to fail. Switching a flag when certain scenes start and end, on the other hand, is dead simple... ]

Hour is a kind of value. The hours are daylight and nighttime.
The circadia is an hour that varies. The circadia is daylight.

To decide if it is day:
	if the circadia is daylight, yes;
	otherwise no.

To decide if it is night:
	if it is day, no;
	otherwise yes.

Part 15 - Better senses of hearing and smell

['Better' only in the sense that they succeed by default: something I've always felt should be the case.]

Chapter 1 - Smell

The block smelling rule is not listed in any rulebook.
Report smelling: say "You smell nothing unexpected.";

Chapter 2 - Hearing

The block listening rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Report listening to the location:
	say "You keep your ears pricked." instead;

Report listening [to something]: say "You hear nothing unexpected.";

Part 16 - Attacking

[Not sure why attacking and kicking were set up as activities rather than simply actions. It's causing a compile problem, so I'm commenting out the troublesome lines until I can determine if it's safe to just delete them. --MSG]

[Fair play, though it caused a bug. I can see what I was *trying* to do - differentiate the actions by context rather than create a separate kicking action - but this doesn't seem like the best approach. Of course, what constitutes "best practices" for I7 is as-yet undiscovered. ]

Chapter 1 - Attacking

[Attacking something is an activity.]

[The block attacking rule is not listed in any rulebook.]

[Check attacking:
	carry out the attacking activity with the noun instead;]

[Rule for attacking something:
	say "Violence isn't the answer to this one."]

Chapter 2 - Kicking

[Kicking is an activity.]

Kicking is an action applying to one thing. Understand "kick [something]" as kicking.

Check kicking the actor when the actor is the player (this is the kicking yourself rule):
	say "Not so hard really, was it?" instead;

Carry out kicking something:
[	begin the kicking activity;]
	try attacking the noun;
[	end the kicking activity;]

Part 19 - Raising and lowering

[These are mainly here to deal with technicalities involving hoods, as on cloaks.]

Raising is an action applying to one thing.
Lowering is an action applying to one thing.

Understand "raise up [something]" as raising.
Understand "raise [something]" as raising.
Understand "raise [something] up" as raising.

Understand "put up [something]" as raising.
Understand "put [something] up" as raising.

Understand the command "lift" as "raise".

Understand "lower [something]" as lowering.

Check raising:
	say "That would not accomplish very much." instead;

Check lowering:
	say "That would not accomplish very much." instead;

Part 20 - Picking locks

Lockpicking is an action applying to one thing.

Understand "pick [something]" as lockpicking.

Check lockpicking (this is the block lockpicking without the lockpick rule):
	if the player does not hold the piece of wire:
		if the piece of wire is visible:
			say "(first taking the lockpick)";
			try silently taking the piece of wire;
			if the player does not hold the piece of wire, stop;
		otherwise:
			say "You would need a lockpick for that." instead;

Check lockpicking up:
	try taking nothing instead;

Carry out lockpicking:
	try unlocking the noun with the piece of wire instead;

Part 21 - Sewer puzzle symbols

[ Get these defined early so as to avoid namespace clashes - with the Market *Square*, for example. ]

Sewer-symbol is a kind of value. The sewer-symbols are square, diamond, circle, triangle, crescent, star, cross, and arrow.

Symbol color is a kind of value. The symbol colors are red, blue, green, and yellow.

Part 23 - Boilerplate 'repeat' phrase

To say repeat phrase:
	say "'[one of]I already told you[or]I told you already[or]Like I said[or]As I said[or]I told you[at random],' says [the current conversationalist],"

To say rp:
	say repeat phrase;

Part 24 - Quip clustering

Clustering relates quips to each other in groups. The verb to be clustered with implies the clustering relation.

Part 25 - Holding out, teasing and taunting

Understand "hold out [something]" as waving. 
Understand "hold out [something] to/for [someone]" as giving it to. 

Understand "tease [animal] with [something]" as showing it to (with nouns reversed). 
Understand "taunt [animal] with [something]" as showing it to (with nouns reversed). 

Part 26 - Extinguishing

Extinguishing is an action applying to one thing.
Understand "extinguish [something]" as extinguishing.
Understand "put out [something]" as extinguishing.

Check extinguishing something:
	say "[The noun] is not alight.";

Part 27 - Buying

The block buying rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Report buying:
	say "Nothing is on sale.";

Does the player mean buying something when the player has the noun:
	it is very unlikely;

Part 28 - Fancy examining

[ Examining as an activity. Ganked verbatim from Example 296, "Crusoe." ]

The examining activity rule is listed instead of the standard examining rule in the carry out examining rules.

Printing the description of something is an activity. 

This is the examining activity rule: 
	carry out the printing the description activity with the noun;

Rule for printing the description of something (called item):
	say "[description of item] [run paragraph on]";

Last after printing the description of something: 
	say paragraph break;

Part 29 - Cutting things with tools

A thing can be sharp or blunt. A thing is usually blunt.

Cutting it with is an action applying to one visible thing and one carried thing.

Understand "cut [something] with [something]" as cutting it with.
Understand "cut through [something]" as cutting.
Understand "cut through [something] with [something]" as cutting it with.

Understand "sever [something]" as cutting.
Understand "sever [something] with [something]" as cutting it with.

Check cutting it with:
	if the second noun is blunt,
		say "[That or those for the second noun] won't cut through [noun]." instead;

Check cutting it with:
	say "Cutting [the noun] up would achieve little." instead;

Part 30 - Running

Understand the command "run" as something new.

Fleeing vaguely is an action applying to nothing.

Understand "run" as fleeing vaguely.
Understand "run away" as fleeing vaguely.
Understand "run [planar direction]" as going.
Understand "flee" as fleeing vaguely.

The fleeing vaguely action has a direction called the chosen-direction.

Rule for setting action variables for fleeing vaguely:
	now the chosen-direction is nothing;
	let the possibilities be {north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest};
	sort the possibilities in random order;
	add {outside, inside} to the possibilities; [to be considered once all else fails]
	repeat with yonder running through the possibilities:
		let the proposed destination be the room-or-door yonder from the location;
		if the proposed destination is a room or the proposed destination is an open door:
			say "(to the [yonder])[command clarification break]";
			now the chosen-direction is yonder;
			continue the action;
	[at this point making no decision, and the action will be terminated.]

Chapter 1 - No Dropping

The can't drop clothes being worn rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Part 37 - Squeezing and crawling

Understand the command "squeeze" as something new.
Understand the commands "squeeze" and "crawl" as "go".

Part 38 - Examining Everything

Understand "examine everything/all" as a mistake ("You will need to be more specific about what you want to look at.").

Part 39 - Cleaning Up Punctuation

[ Cleaning up apostrophes and hyphens saves lots of work when declaring synonyms. It treats "Grubber's" the same as "Grubbers", for example, which makes the parser more forgiving of typos. It also means if you have a "reddish-green" apple, you can declare the synonyms "red", "reddish", and "green", and "reddish-green" will be automatically taken care of.

However, it does mean that possessive words must always be written WITHOUT an apostrophe when used as an object name in code (such as Grubber's), so that the name can be recognized by the parser. Even though it's always WITH an apostrophe in printed text. This is a small pain but, I think, a reasonable payoff.

GJ: Annoyingly, pieces of text separated by apostrophes aren't glued back together after being removed: so "examine grubber's market" translates to "examine grubber s market", which is bound to fail. The Punctuation Removal extension does this work by rewriting bytes in the input buffer, which is obviously fast, but we can't do it the same way if we want to take out the apostrophe altogether. Hence, a regular expression to do this job.
]

After reading a command:
	remove stray punctuation;
	[ remove apostrophes; ]
	let T be indexed text;
	let T be the player's command;
	replace the regular expression "\[']" in T with "";
	[ this next bit cleans up hyphens, which isn't covered by Emily's extension, although it should be ]
	replace the regular expression "\-" in T with " ";
	change the text of the player's command to T;

Part 40 - Fixing Response For Examining Objects in Adjacent Rooms

[ Objects in adjacent rooms should not be in scope except in very specific circumstances. However, somewhere along the way we created a bug where objects in other rooms are in scope when the player EXAMINES. However, examining something in another room generates an error message -- "You cannot reach into [that room]," which is just plain awful.

I've not been able to figure out exactly what causes this behavior yet, so until I do, here is a patch.

First we disable the basic accessibility rule, because that triggers the error message before any action-specific hooks are available. That leaves examining something in another room totally "blank," with no response at all, allowing us to fill in our own with an instead rule.]

A procedural rule:
	if we are inspecting something then ignore the basic accessibility rule.

Instead of inspecting something when the noun is not a room and the noun is not in the location:
	say "You can't see any such thing."

Part 41 - Multiple Removing (clothes)

[This doesn't really add multiple object grammar to the taking off action. When the player types something like REMOVE HAT AND CLOAK, the game will ask "what do you want to remove those things from?" Of course the obvious answer is MYSELF. This rule ensures that the game will interpret this as taking off the clothes. Tricky, if I may say so.]

Instead of removing something from yourself, try taking off the noun.

Part 42 - Get Down

Understand "get [down]" as going.

Part 43 - Can't Insert Something When It's Already In There Rule

[A check rule for inserting to generate more intuitive responses.]

Check an actor inserting something into (this is the can't insert something when it's already in there rule):
	if the noun is inside the second noun:
		say "[The noun] is already inside [the second noun]!" instead;

The can't insert something when it's already in there rule is listed before the can't insert what's not held rule in the check inserting it into rulebook.

Part 44 - Following

[This is implemented so the player can follow Bobby around during Bobby's adventure.]

Following is an action applying to one visible thing.

Understand "follow" as following. [Otherwise we get nonsensical defaults, usually "the group of mercenaries" or somesuch]
Understand "follow [any person]" as following.

Rule for supplying a missing noun while following:
	say "No-one is leading the way.";

Rule for supplying a missing noun while following during Bobby's Adventure:
	change the noun to Bobby;

Check following (this is the can't follow someone who's not here rule):
	if the noun is not in the location, say "You don't see [the noun] here." instead.

Check following (this is the can't follow someone who's not going anywhere rule):
	say "[The noun] isn't going anywhere." instead.

Instead of following Bobby during Bobby's adventure:
	if Bobby is in the location,
		say "But Bobby's right here!" instead;
	say "[conditional paragraph break]";
	if the location is the Woods:
		let Bobby's wake be the way of the split sapling;
	otherwise:
		let Bobby's wake be entry 1 of Bobby's trail;
	try going Bobby's wake.

Part 45 - Praying

Praying is an action applying to one topic.

Understand "pray [text]" as praying.
Understand "pray" as praying.

Carry out praying:
	say "You mutter a quick prayer under your breath. As usual, there is no reply."

Understand "hide in/inside/on [something]" as entering.

Understand "hide under/underneath/behind [something]" as a mistake ("There's not enough room for you to hide there.").

Understand "hide [other things] in/inside/down/under/behind [something]" as inserting it into.

Understand "hide" as a mistake ("There's nowhere for you to hide here.").

Chapter 1 - Jack herself

Section - appearance

Instead of examining the player, say "Most people know you as 'Jack,' a fourteen-year-old street urchin of uncertain means. You are slight of build for a boy your age, though your baggy clothes hide much of your physique. Your shoulder-length hair is ragged, a victim of many self-inflicted trimmings. Though usually in need of a good scrubbing, you are an attractive youth, with a softness to your face that makes you seem younger than your years.[paragraph break]Fortunately, it also leads people to underestimate your wiles and resourcefulness, which have caused more than one stallkeeper to call you by your second most common sobriquet, 'Lousy thief!'[paragraph break]Only a few people know you by your real name, and you are pleased to keep it that way."
Understand "Jack", "Jacqueline" as yourself.

Best not try anything too tricky for a while."

Instead of smelling the player, say "You smell like you haven't had a bath in a long, long time. Which, to be honest, you haven't."

Instead of smelling the player when Escape Through the Sewer has happened and the player is not clean:
	say "You already needed a bath before wading through the sewers... now you would [i]kill[r] for one."

Servants from the aristocratic districts and villagers from outside Toresal crush themselves into the maze of stalls and stretched canvas, hoping to beat the noontime heat and get the farmers[apostrophe] produce while it's still fresh. The press of bodies, the din of haggling and bargains struck — it all makes getting around unnoticed easier, although not necessarily more pleasant. No fewer than half a dozen stall-gazing bumpkins have trod on your feet already this morning. You've kept your mouth shut, though. People remember an urchin who gives lip.[paragraph break]'See anything you like?' asks the silk seller, with a teasing smile. You smile back. You couldn’t afford one of her cloaks without nicking a fat purse first, and Teisha doesn’t approve of you stealing from people, even when they’re not her customers.[paragraph break]'Oh, these are [i]much[r] too plain,' you scoff, even as you gaze wistfully at the bright colors, the beautiful embroidery. Time for a bit of breakfast, you decide, and anyway if you linger too long, people will wonder what a boy is doing shopping for women's cloaks. 'Perhaps I'll come back this afternoon, when you've put out your better wares.'[paragraph break]Teisha laughs. 'Don't be a stranger, Jack.'[paragraph break]You make your way through the market, nicking an apple from the fruit stall while its owner argues with a fat Easterner over local politics. Everyone seems to be talking politics these days, you've noticed. Everywhere people are heatedly discussing Baron Fossville's tax policies or something called the 'Ascension' — whatever that is. Boring stuff, really. Finally you reach a quiet alley where you can catch a breath from the crowds and enjoy your apple in peace.[paragraph break]You settle yourself on a crate and take a bite of your apple.

One of them is barking orders at the others in an angry voice.". The description is "They're not Lord's Guards, that's for sure. They wear no insignia, for one thing. Their arms and armor are mismatched, ugly, and scarred — not an unfit description of the men themselves, either.

Chapter 2 - Generic Stallkeepers

Section 1 - Definition

A stallkeeper is a kind of person. A stallkeeper is usually scenery. The description of a stallkeeper is usually "The stallkeeper looks nervous and irritable. Armed thugs stomping around the Grubber's Market is not good for business." 

[Stallkeepers can be described by their wares -- e.g., a "fruit merchant" or a "weapon seller". However, we don't want that to clash with simply referring to "fruit" or "rope", so we'll use a disambiguation rule.]

Rule for printing the name of a stallkeeper:
	say "stallkeeper";

Does the player mean doing something with a stallkeeper: it is unlikely.

Understand "stallkeeper", "shopkeeper", "merchant", "seller", "stall/shop keeper", "merchant", "person", "vendor", "man", "salesman", "sales man"  as a stallkeeper.

Instead of smelling a stallkeeper:
	say "The stallkeepers are faring slightly better than the shoppers in the body odor department, if only because they can sit behind their stalls and don't have to press up with the crowds quite so much.";

Instead of listening to a stallkeeper:
	say "The stallkeeper is alternating between hawking his wares, haggling with customers, and muttering about the general stinginess of the crowds.";

Instead of kissing a stallkeeper, say "You're pretty sure the stallkeeper wouldn't appreciate that."

Every turn when the player can see a stallkeeper and a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
	if a plural-named stall display is in the location:
		let X be a random plural-named stall display in the location;
		say "[one of]'[sales pitch for X]!' calls the stallkeeper.[or]The stallkeeper haggles with a customer over the price of [X].[or]The stallkeeper carefully straightens his display of [X].[at random]";

To say sales pitch for (X - a stall display):
	say "[one of]I have [X] for sale[or]Get your [X] right here[or]Fine quality [X][or]Fine quality [X] for sale[or]You'll not find better [X] in all of Toresal[at random]";

Section 2 - Generic Stallkeeper Conversations

Instead of talking to a stallkeeper in the presence of oblivious wandering mercenaries:
	say "Better find somewhere else to chat; if you start making conversation, the mercenaries might take notice.";

Instead of talking to a stallkeeper in the presence of [approaching or grabbing] wandering mercenaries:
	say "No time to chat now; you've got to run!";

Rule for initiating conversation with a stallkeeper:
	change the chosen opening gambit to ST1;

ST1 is a quip. The display text is "'What do you want?' snaps the stallkeeper." 

ST2 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'What do you have for sale?" The display text is "'So, what are you selling today?' you ask, trying to sound casual." The following quip is ST5.

ST3 is a quip. The menu text is "'Do you know anything about these mercenaries?'" The display text is "'You know anything about these mercenaries running around Grubber's?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Only that they're bad for business,' mutters the stallkeeper. 'I don't know who hired them, but the Lord's Guard ought to run them off.'" 

ST4 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'I'd like to buy something, please.'" The display text is "'I'd like one of those, please,' you say, pointing." The following quip is ST5.

ST5 is a quip. The display text is "The merchant sneers at you. 'You have any coin?'" 

ST6 is a quip. The menu text is "'Yes.'" The display text is "'Yes,' you respond indignantly, 'and lots of it.'[paragraph break]The stallkeeper snorts derisively. 'If you've half a penny that isn't stolen from somewhere, I'll sell my stall to the monkey. Now go bother someone else before I call those mercenaries over here myself!'"

ST7 is a quip. The menu text is "'No.'" The display text is "'Um, no,' you say.[paragraph break]The stallkeeper rolls his eyes. 'Do I look like I have time to gab at you all day? Beat it, kid.'"

ST8 is a quip. The menu text is "'Never mind.'" The display text is "'Uh, never mind.'[paragraph break]'Whatever,' the stallkeeper mutters, and goes back to nervously scanning the crowd."

ST9 is a quip. The menu text is "'Good-bye.'" The display text is "'Yeah, fine, scram,' the stallkeeper mutters."

The response of ST1 is { ST2, ST3, ST4, ST9 }.

The response of ST3 is { ST2, ST4, ST9 }.

The response of ST5 is { ST6, ST7, ST8 }.

After populating ST1:
	if ST2 is fired begin;
		remove ST2 from the current conversation, if present;
	end if;
	if ST3 is fired begin;
		remove ST3 from the current conversation, if present;
	end if;
	if ST4 is fired begin;
		remove ST4 from the current conversation, if present;
	end if;

After populating ST3:
	if ST2 is fired begin;
		remove ST2 from the current conversation, if present;
	end if;
	if ST4 is fired begin;
		remove ST4 from the current conversation, if present;
	end if;

Section 3 - Impatient stallkeepers

Stallkeeper patience count is a number that varies.

Every turn when the player is on the move in a shop:
	change the stallkeeper patience count to 0.

Before talking to a stallkeeper:
	increment the stallkeeper patience count by 1;
	continue the action;

After talking to a stallkeeper when the stallkeeper patience count is 2:
	say "The stallkeeper suddenly looks exasperated. 'Didn't I tell you to take it somewhere else?'";

After talking to a stallkeeper when the stallkeeper patience count > 2:
	say "'I said, [one of]beat it[or]scram[or]get out of here[at random]!' the stallkeeper yells."

Section 4 - Unshopperly behavior

Instead of doing something other than stealing when the noun is a stall display and a stallkeeper is nearby:
	if the action requires a touchable noun begin;
		say "'Hey!' the stallkeeper glares at you. 'Keep your sticky fingers away from the goods.'" instead;
	end if;
	continue the action;

Chapter 4 - Actions relating to commerce

Section 1 - Stealing

Stealing is an action applying to one visible thing.
Understand "steal [something]" as stealing.

Understand "snatch [something]" as stealing.
Understand "grab [something]" as stealing.
Understand "loot [something]" as stealing.
Understand "nick [something]" as stealing.
Understand "shoplift [something]" as stealing.

A person can be a successful thief or a mere urchin. The player is a mere urchin.

Check stealing:
	if the noun is not merchandise begin;
		try taking the noun instead;
	end if;

Check stealing:
	if the noun is on-stage begin;
		try taking the noun instead;
	end if;

Carry out stealing:
	if the player is a mere urchin,
		now the player is a successful thief;
	if the player holds the satchel begin;
		move the noun to the satchel;
	otherwise;
		move the noun to the player;
	end if;
	now the location is blocked;

After stealing something when the player was a mere urchin:
	say "Ah, [i]this[r] is something you know how to do, at least. You sidle up casually to the stall, wait until the stallkeeper seems preoccupied, then reach out and pluck [the noun] from [its or their for the noun] shelf.[paragraph break]Suddenly the stallkeeper jabs his finger at you and screams, [i]'Stop, thief!'[no line break][r][paragraph break]Apparently, he wasn't quite as preoccupied as you thought.[paragraph break]You sprint through the crowd, stuffing [the noun] into your satchel. This stallkeeper will be on the lookout for you now; probably best to stay away from this part of Grubber's for a while.";
	move the player to a random adjacent unblocked room;
	update the character list;

After stealing something when the player was a successful thief:
	say "With the stallkeepers all on edge about the mercenaries, it's not likely you'll be able to nick anything without someone noticing. Still, nothing ventured...[paragraph break][i]'Thief!'[no line break][paragraph break][r]Here you go again.[paragraph break]You sprint through the crowd, stuffing [the noun] into your satchel. This stallkeeper will be on the lookout for you now; probably best to stay away from this part of Grubber's for a while.";

	update the character list;

Section 2 - Wares

Wares are a kind of thing. Wares are usually scenery. Understand "merchandise", "wares", "goods", "fare" as wares. 

Does the player mean doing something with wares: it is unlikely.

Rule for printing the name of wares:

Section 3 - Stall displays

A stall display is a kind of thing. A stall display is usually scenery. A stall display has a thing called the corresponding item.

Representation relates a stall display (called the display) to a thing (called the representative item) when the representative item is the corresponding item of the display. The verb to represent (it represents, they represent, it represented, it is represented, it is representing) implies the representation relation.

[ [This was a nice idea, but too slow in places with lots of displays, i.e. fruit stall]
Understand "[something related by representation]" as a stall display when the corresponding item of the item described is not enclosed by the location. [Condition attached, because e.g. when we are holding an apple and say > EXAMINE APPLE, we don't ideally want to be sidetracked looking at the fruit bins. ]
]

Does the player mean stealing a stall display:
	it is very likely.

Does the player mean taking a stall display:
	it is likely.

Before taking a stall display:
	let the stolen item be the corresponding item of the noun;
	if the stolen item is off-stage begin;
		try stealing the noun instead;
	end if;

Part 2 - Mercenary Encounters

[ Stick around for too long in Grubber's Market, and the wandering mercenary will come to beat you up. Lots of timing issues here. ]

A person [ie the mercenary] can be oblivious, approaching, or grabbing. A person is usually oblivious.

Chapter 1 - A Pair of Angry Mercenaries

Section 1 - Description of Mercenaries

Some wandering mercenaries are a man. The printed name is "mercenaries".
Understand "man", "men", "soldier", "soldiers", "thug", "thugs", "bravo", "bravos", "mercenary", "mercenaries" as the wandering mercenaries.

The description is "Rough and ugly, with dirty clothes and mean, scarred faces. They carry serious-looking swords on their hips."

A sword is carried by the wandering mercenaries. The description is "Not some decorated dandy's blades, these. Their steel is dull and tarnished, honed to a wicked edge. Nothing less than three-foot-long, practical tools for stabbing people dead." Understand "swords", "blade", "blades", "sharp", "serious", "looking", "dull", "tarnished", "steel", "metal", "wicked", "honed", "edge", "three/3 foot/feet", "long", "practical", "tool", "tools" as the sword.

Rule for printing the name of the sword when clarifying the parser's choice of something:
	say "mercenary's blade";

Before taking the sword when the sword is carried by the wandering mercenaries:
	say "Even if you did manage to nick one of those swords without getting yourself totally killed, you wouldn't know what to do with it once you had it." instead;

Section 2 - Initial appearance

Section 4 - Waiting for them to turn up

The wandering mercenaries have a number called the timeout.
When play begins:
	change the timeout of the wandering mercenaries to a random number between 1 and 3;

To decide if the mercenaries will not recognise us:
	if the player does not wear the hat and the mercenary captain is wise to our tricks, decide no; [i.e. they will recognise us]
	if the player wears the hat, decide no; [i.e. they will recognise us]
	[otherwise] decide yes. [i.e. they will not recognise us]

Every turn when in the Open-Air Market [region] during Avoiding Soldiers :

Chapter 2 - Captured

Section 1 - Only a matter of time 'til you're caught

The grabbing countdown is a number that varies. The grabbing countdown is [initially] 2 [* but it needs to be reset, each time the mercenaries notice us].

	change the grabbing countdown to the grabbing countdown - 1.

Section 2 - Gotcha!

At the time when the leader arrives:

Chapter 4 - Teisha

Section 1 - Description

Teisha is a woman, in Grubbers Market Teishas Tent. The initial appearance of Teisha is "Teisha sits on a stool in back, smiling distractedly." Teisha is female. The description of Teisha is "Teisha is a short, busty woman with a smile as warm as her tumbling red curls. She likes you, and she knows that you'd never nick from her stall, so she lets you hang around the stall and look through the merchandise. She also knows your big secret (guessed it the very first time she caught you loitering at the tent flap), which is a little bit scary and a little bit of a relief — it's nice to be able to let your guard down and talk to someone outside Maiden House." Understand "woman", "merchant", "saleswoman", "seller", "vendor", "clothier", "short", "busty", "warm", "smile", "tumbling", "red", "curls", "hair", "Teishas" as Teisha.

A measuring cord is carried by Teisha. The description is "It's a five-foot-long length of cord, marked off in ten segments, used to take a customer's measurements." Understand "Teishas" as the measuring cord.

Instead of kissing Teisha, say "You throw your arms around Teisha's neck and give her a kiss on the cheek. She laughs and looks at you strangely. 'What's got into you, Jack?'"

Rule for printing the name of Teisha:
	say "Teisha"; [rather than just "stallkeeper"]

Section 2 - Actions

A person can be vocal or silenced. A person is usually vocal.

[ We silence Teisha from performing her idle action, every time we talk to her. This is to prevent excess verbiage of the following sort:

>ask teisha about cloak
"I can't just give you one, sweetie," Teisha says, sadly. "These silks are expensive, and I have to pay my suppliers and make a living for myself. If you have coin, or something worth trading, maybe I can cut you a deal. Otherwise..."

Teisha toys with her measuring cord, spinning it idly.

...This should genericize quite easily, such that we treat everyone with idle behaviour in the same way, and handle this silencing automatically. Watch this space.

]

Every turn when Teisha is nearby and the player is not on the move and Teisha is not silenced:
	if a random chance of 1 in 5 succeeds begin;
		say "[one of]Teisha hums quietly to herself[or]Teisha smiles at you warmly[or]Teisha brushes a loose thread from the sleeve of one of her gowns[or]Teisha toys with her measuring cord, spinning it idly[at random].";
	end if;

After firing a quip when the current conversationalist is Teisha:
	silence Teisha;

The last every turn rule when Teisha is silenced:
	now Teisha is not silenced.

To silence (the certain somebody - a person):
	now the certain somebody is silenced.

Section 3 - Reactions

Chatting to Teisha is a recurring scene. Chatting to Teisha begins when the player is in Teishas Tent. Chatting to Teisha ends when the player is not in Teishas Tent.

When Chatting to Teisha begins:
	if the player is in Grubbers Market Teishas Tent for the first time begin;
		start conversation with Teisha on TE1;
	otherwise;
		if the last room was Outside Silk Stall begin;
			if TE2 is unfired and TE6 is unfired and TE5 is unfired begin;
				start conversation with Teisha on TE5;
			otherwise;
				start conversation with Teisha on TE9;
			end if;
		end if;
	end if.

Rule for initiating conversation with Teisha:
	change the chosen opening gambit to TE10.

Instead of trading something for the collective cloaks:
	try trading the noun with Teisha; 

Does the player mean trading something for the collective cloaks: it is likely.
Does the player mean buying the collective cloaks: it is likely. 

After trading something with Teisha:
	if the noun is not the necklace,
		start conversation with Teisha on TE16;

After trading the necklace with Teisha:
	try giving the necklace to Teisha instead;	

Instead of giving or showing the necklace to Teisha:
	start conversation with Teisha on TE20.

After going through the narrow gap from Grubbers Market Teishas Tent:
	if Tent Escape is happening begin;
		say "Without pausing to think, you dive through the back flap.";
	otherwise;
		say "[first time]Teisha holds the back flap back as you duck through. 'Be careful now...' she says, '...[run paragraph on][i]Jacqueline[r].'[subsequently]'Careful out there,' calls Teisha as you duck through the back again.[only]";
	end if;
	continue the action;

Before going south in Grubbers Market Teishas Tent:
	say "[first time]'Good-bye, Teisha,' you call as you head back out into the market.[subsequently]'[']Bye, Teisha,' you say.[paragraph break]'Take care, Jack,' calls Teisha.[only]";

Section 4 - Conversation

[Tried defining these in a table, a la 15.16 "Defining things with tables" but ran into difficulties and I7 compiler crashes. Probably to do with the response lists referring to other items defined in the same table. ]

TE1 is a quip. The display text is "'Hello, Jack,' says Teisha. 'Change your mind about that cloak?' Then she gets a look at your face and frowns. 'Something the matter, sweetie? You look spooked.'"

TE2 is a quip. The menu text is "'There are big guys with swords chasing me.'" The display text is "'Now that you mention it, I am a bit spooked,' you say, trying to catch your breath. 'There's a bunch of big guys with swords out there, chasing me all over the market!'[paragraph break]Teisha frowns. 'Big guys with — you mean [i]mercenaries[r]? In Grubber's?' She peeks out through the front flap. 'Brigid help us,' she mutters, glancing back at you. 'Don't tell me what they're after you for — I don't want to know.'" 

TE3 is a quip. The menu text is "'Actually, I'd like to look at that cloak again.'" The display text is "'Um, actually,' you mutter, glancing nervously at the tent flap, 'I'd like to look at that cloak again. If you don't mind.'[paragraph break]Teisha gives you a suspicious look. 'Well, all right, Jack,' she says finally. 'Browse all you like.'" 

TE4 is a quip. The menu text is "'No, everything's fine.'" The display text is "'No, no,' you say quickly. 'Everything's just fine. Couldn't be better.'[paragraph break]Teisha raises one eyebrow at you, but doesn't push it." 

TE5 is a quip. The display text is "'Back so soon, Jack?' Teisha asks. She eyes you closely. 'Are you [i]sure[r] there's nothing the matter?'" 

TE6 is a quip. The menu text is "'No, really, everything's just tricky.'" The display text is "'No, really,' you say, in a not-quite-steady voice. 'Everything's just tricky.'[paragraph break]Teisha smirks. 'Uh-huh. You know I don't just sit by myself in this silk tent all day, don't you, Jack? I do have some idea of what's going on in the world outside, you know. I know there are mercenaries searching Grubber's, and I'm guessing they're probably after you.' Her voice softens, and she puts her hand on your shoulder. 'Don't worry, Jack. I don't need to know what you did to get them after you. I won't turn you in.'"

TE7 is a quip. The menu text is "'I need somewhere to hide.'" The display text is "'I need help, Teisha,' you tell her plaintively. 'I need somewhere to hide.'[paragraph break]Teisha sighs. Although you know she cares about you, you also know that Teisha is a smart, practical woman, and first and foremost she is worried about losing her customers. 'All right,' she says, 'you can stay in here as long as you like, but if the mercenaries decide to search the place I can't stop them. Probably your best bet is to slip out that way—' she points to the narrow gap in the back wall of the tent. 'I'll pretend I never saw you.'"

TE8 is a quip. The menu text is "'I need a disguise.'" The display text is "Suddenly your eyes fall on the many cloaks hanging among Teisha's silks. 'I could use one of your cloaks as a disguise,' you say. 'The mercenaries expect me to be wearing my usual ratty stuff.'[paragraph break]Teisha sighs. 'Jack... I'm sorry. These silks are expensive, and I have to pay my suppliers and make a living for myself. If you have coin, or something worth trading, maybe I can cut you a deal. Otherwise...' she shakes her head."

TE9 is a quip. The display text is "Teisha's face falls as you stumble back into the tent. 'You're still here?' she asks. 'I'd hoped you'd gotten away by now.'" 

TE10 is a quip. The menu text is "'Can I ask you a question?'" The display text is "'Teisha, can I ask you a question?'[paragraph break]'Of course, Jack,' she says." 

TE11 is a quip. The menu text is "'What can you tell me about Grubber's Market?'"
The display text is "[first time]'What can you tell me about Grubber's Market?' you ask. 'Are there any other ways out of here?'[paragraph break]Teisha shrugs. 'I figured you'd know more about the place than I do, the way you sneak about,' she says. 'From the northwest junction you can leave the city. East will take you to Commerce Street. Those are the only two ways out of the square, as far as I know.'[subsequently][rp] 'north from the northwest junction, or east from the east junction. That's all I know.'[only]"

TE12 is a quip. The menu text is "'Who's selling what today?'" The display text is "[first time]'I know that different merchants set up their stalls on different days of the week,' you say. 'So who's selling what today?'[paragraph break]'Well, there's the fruit stall on the northeast corner, but that's there every day.' says Teisha. 'To the north is a grocer's stall; a hat seller to the southeast; to the west is an herb seller and the gem merchant; and the leatherworker and weaponsmith have set up shop on the south end. The inner ring is me, a rope merchant, a pottery merchant, and that awful candlemaker — the stench has been driving off my customers all morning.'[subsequently][rp] 'there's the fruit stall to the northeast; the grocer to the north; the hat seller to the southeast; the herb seller and the gem merchant to the west; the leatherworker and weaponsmith to the south; and me, the rope merchant, the potter merchant, and the candlemaker in the inner ring.'[only]"

TE13 is a quip. The menu text is "'What's behind your tent?'" The display text is "[first time]'What's that behind your tent?' you ask, nodding towards the back exit.[paragraph break]'There's nothing back there except the central pole holding up the big awning over the market,' Teisha says. 'That's why all the merchants want this spot,' she adds, '...it's got the best shade.'[subsequently][rp] 'it's just a big pole.'[only]"

TE14 is a quip. The menu text is "'Do you make these clothes yourself?'" The display text is "[first time]'These clothes are all so beautiful,' you say. 'Do you make them yourself?'[paragraph break]Teisha smiles. 'Some of them,' she says. 'Most of them I sell on consignment. One of these days, I'm going to clear enough profit to rent a shop on Commerce Street and move out of this hot, smelly tent.'[subsequently][rp] 'some of them I make myself, some I sell for others.'[only]".

TE15 is a quip. The menu text is "'What's the deal with that monkey?'" The display text is "[first time]'The gem merchant sounds like he's got a real vendetta against that monkey,' you remark. 'What's the story with them?'[paragraph break]Teisha rolls her eyes. 'That pesky thing came in on the fruit vendor's wagon yesterday and just made itself at home. Now it's all over the place, bothering everybody. Fortunately, it likes shiny things more than it likes women's clothes. Oh, and bananas. The little rodent loves bananas. Constantly drops the peels on the roof of my tent.'[subsequently][rp] 'it just runs around, eats bananas, and steals anything shiny that isn't nailed down.'[only]".

TE16 is a quip. The menu text is "'What will you trade for a cloak?'" The display text is "[first time]'I [i]need[r] one of those cloaks, Teisha,' you say. 'Just tell me what you want for it, and I'll get it, somehow.'[paragraph break]Teisha thinks for a moment. 'Most of the things you'd find in Grubber's are staple goods, not much use to me. I'd need something with [i]resale[r] value. Jewelry, or the like. But don't you go stealing anything, Jack,' she adds hastily. 'I don't want you getting into even more trouble than you're already in!'[subsequently][rp] 'a piece of jewelry would do nicely.'[only]".

TE17 is a quip. The menu text is "'One more question.'" The display text is "'[one of]Can I ask you another question[or]One more question[or]Can I ask you something else[or]Do you mind if I ask you one more question[at random]?' you ask.[paragraph break]'[one of]Of course, Jack[or]Ask away[or]No problem[or]Sure[at random],' says Teisha." 

TE18 is a quip. The menu text is "'Never mind.'" The display text is "'Um, never mind,' you say.[paragraph break]'All right,' says Teisha. 'Just let me know if you need anything.'"

TE19 is a quip. The menu text is "'Thanks.'" The display text is "'Thanks, Teisha.'[paragraph break]'No problem, Jack.'"

TE20 is a quip. The menu text is "'Will you trade me a cloak for this necklace?'" The display text is "You hold out the necklace, dangling it by its chain. 'Have a look at this, Teisha,' you say. 'You think this is worth one of your cloaks?'[paragraph break]Teisha's eyebrow shoots up, but she manages to hide her excitement with the coolness of a professional haggler. 'That's not bad,' she mutters. 'Most of Hathid's wares are just pretty glass, but this...' She gives you a look. 'Now, tell me the truth, Jack, you didn't just steal this from somewhere, did you?'[paragraph break]You shake your head proudly. It's not [i]exactly[r] a lie.[paragraph break]'Well, not that it matters.' The necklace disappears into one of Teisha's pockets. 'Let's see...' she starts searching through the clothes, looking for something in your size. 'This should fit. I think it suits you, too.' She holds out a light green cloak. 'What do you think?'[paragraph break]It takes your breath away, but you try to hide your eagerness just as Teisha hid hers. 'It's tricky,' you say, nodding casually.[paragraph break]Teisha laughs. 'Then it's yours.'"

TE21 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think about Baron Fossville?'". The display text is "[first time]'It seems like everyone has an opinion about Baron Fossville, lately,' you remark. 'What's yours?'[paragraph break]Teisha laughs. 'So you've noticed it too, huh? I don't usually like to talk politics, which means I haven't had much in the way of conversation in Grubber's Market lately.' She shrugs. 'I don't like his high taxes, but who does? Fossville doesn't strike me as a very nice person, but I guess he doesn't have to be.'[subsequently][rp] 'I don't like him very much, but there's not much use complaining.'[only]".

TE22 is a quip. The menu text is "'What's this Ascension thing?'". The display text is "[first time]'What's this Ascension thing I keep hearing about?' you ask. 'Everyone in the market seems to be talking about it.'[paragraph break]'Ascension is when they name the heir to the throne of all Miradania,' Teisha says. 'Everyone's talking about it because the King didn't explicitly name his daughter heir before he died, so now there's talk the new ruler might be chosen by a council of noblemen. I don't see why it's so interesting, frankly. What the King and Queen do miles away in the capital doesn't have much to do with how many cloaks I sell today.'[subsequently][rp] 'it's the naming of the new heir to the throne. That's really all I know; I don't pay much attention to Royal politics.'[only]".

	let c be a random cable that points noun;
	if c is not nothing,
		try sliding down c barehanded instead.

Its little face contorts into bizarre expressions as it wrestles with the conflicting desires to grab the tasty treat, hold onto the shiny trinket, and stay out of your reach, all at the same time.[paragraph break]Suddenly the monkey lunges. You make a grab with your free hand. The monkey grabs the banana just as your fingers hook around the necklace's chain. The monkey screams, jumps six feet straight up, lands on your head, and scampers off down the wire behind you. Your heart leaps into your throat as you lose your balance on top of the pole. You totter, pinwheel your arms... and stay on.[paragraph break]You're breathing hard, but you're safe. And you have the necklace.[paragraph break]Somewhere far below you, a stallkeeper is cursing and wiping smushed banana off his face." instead.

	say mercenary brutality ending;

To say mercenary brutality ending:
	say "The captain soon arrives, followed by two more of his men. They take your other arm as their leader smiles. 'Good work, dims. Got ourselves a nice little commission with this one.' And before you can react, he takes a sack of black cloth from his belt and jerks it down over your head.[paragraph break]Everything goes dark. You can't breathe. You struggle, but you can no more break the iron grip on your arms than you could uproot a tree. The men holding you curse. Dimly, you hear shouts from the crowd — someone protesting this rough treatment of a child.[paragraph break]'Don't worry, m'lady,' laughs the mercenary leader. 'We'll treat the little rat nice an['] gentle. Like this, see?'[paragraph break]Something huge and heavy crashes into your head, and the rest of your senses are ripped away.

Commerce Street is home to a slightly more upscale class of merchant, and business here is not quite as frantic as in Grubber's Market. Transactions tend to be calmer, more deliberate, and involve significantly more money. The Lord's Guard will be far less tolerant of a pack of armed bullies menacing the citizens of the upper class, so it's unlikely that the mercenaries will follow you here. And even if they did, there are too many streets and side alleys for them to block off your escape.[paragraph break]Gratefully, you remove the cloak, which was beginning to stick to your skin with all the sweat. Now it's time to pause, catch your breath, and try to figure out why they were after you in the first place.";

	if the player has been in the Sewer,
		change the chosen opening gambit to GE19;

GE1 is a quip. The display text is "You lean casually on the counter, and the baker raises one flour-dusted eyebrow. 'You want something?' he asks."

GE2 is a quip. The menu text is "'How's business?'". The display text is "[first time]'So how's business, Germaise?' you ask.[paragraph break]Germaise sighs. 'I've had the ovens fired up night and day all week trying to fill a rush order for Baron Fossville. It's good for business, don't get me wrong, but...' He slaps dispiritedly at the dough, sending up a puff of flour. 'You have to spend [i]time[r] on a pastry to make it just right. Breaks my heart to do slapdash work like this, but what can you do? The Baron wants quantity, not quality.'[subsequently][rp] 'just trying to get all these pastries done before tomorrow night.'[only]"

GE3 is a quip. The menu text is "'What have you got to sell today?'". The display text is "[first time]Knowing that the question always puts him in a good mood, you ask, 'What are you selling today, Germaise?'[paragraph break]A smile spreads across the baker's flour-streaked face. 'What is it you desire?' he replies. 'I have round breads and flat breads, grain breads and white breads, hard breads and soft breads, long loaves and demi-loaves. I make rolls, muffins, pastries, cakes, and the most delicious fried dough you will ever taste. It is no joke to say that my buns are the most firm and delicious in all of Toresal.'[subsequently][rp] 'I have every kind of bread and pastry you could imagine.'[only]"

GE4 is a quip. The menu text is "'Do you know about the mercenaries in Grubber's Market?'". The display text is "[first time]'So...' you say, trying to play it tricky, 'you hear anything about mercenaries running around Grubber's?'[paragraph break]'Eh?' Germaise looks up, startled. 'Mercenaries in Grubber's?'[paragraph break]'Oh yeah,' you say. 'I, uh, heard they were kicking over stalls, scaring the locals, really roughing up the place. I was just wondering if you knew anything about it?'[paragraph break]'Did they knock over Teisha's tent?' Germaise blurts out. 'Is Teisha all right?'[subsequently]'I only know what I heard from you,' says Germaise.[only]"

GE5 is a quip. The menu text is "'Have you seen Bobby around?'". The display text is "[first time]'You seen Bobby around lately?'[paragraph break]'Seen him?' Germaise snaps. 'I chased him out of here for stealing one of my tarts! You tell him from me, he comes around my bakery again, he gets the wrong end of my bread knife in his you-know-what!'[paragraph break]'So... that'd be a [i]no[r], then?'[paragraph break]Germaise sniffs and pounds at his dough.[subsequently][rp] 'I haven't seen him, and that's a good thing.'[only]"

GE6 is a quip. The menu text is "'Nothing, never mind.'" The display text is "'Oh, nothing,' you say.[paragraph break]Germaise nods and goes back to his dough."

GE7 is a quip. The menu text is "'What's the occasion for the pastries?'" The display text is "[first time]'So what are all the pastries for?' you ask. Somehow, you never envisioned Fossville as someone who was particularly passionate about eating pastries.[paragraph break]Germaise shrugs. 'Fossville should tell me his business? Maybe he just likes pastries. Maybe he's throwing a big party. All the more reason to take extra care over the pastries if that's the case, but what do I know? I'm just the baker.'[subsequently][rp] 'I don't know why he wants all the pastries. I suppose he's entertaining someone.'[only]"

GE8 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of Baron Fossville?'" The display text is "[first time]'What do you think of Baron Fossville?' you ask. 'It sounds like you're not exactly pleased to be getting his custom.'[paragraph break]'No, no, it's not that, not that at all,' Germaise says hastily. 'Fossville runs the city well and his taxes are fair. They say he has a temper, but who am I to judge? Now, the Duke before him...' he seems on the verge of saying something, but then thinks better of it. 'Eh, well,' he mutters, and attacks his dough with renewed vigor.[subsequently][rp] 'he's no worse than most.'[only]"

GE9 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of the Queen?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you think of the Queen?' you ask.[paragraph break]Germaise shrugs and makes a dismissive [i]pfff[r] noise, blowing a cloud of flour from his moustache. 'I try not to. The King placed a greater value on looks than wisdom, and that is his royal prerogative, but then he went and died and the rest of us had to live with the consequences.'[subsequently][rp] 'she's a poor ruler at best, a Royal fool at worst.'[only]"

GE10 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of the Princess?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you think of the Princess?' you ask.[paragraph break]Germaise shrugs. 'I hear she's a pretty thing, like her mother once was. That plus the throne makes her quite the prize.'[subsequently][rp] 'I don't know much about her.'[only]"

GE11 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you know about the Ascension?'".
The display text is "[first time]'It seems like the Ascension is all anyone talks about lately,' you say. 'What's the big deal, anyway?'[paragraph break]Germaise rolls his eyes and flaps his flour-white hands in the air. 'Eh, a big how-do-you-do about nothing, believe me. The Ascension is when the throne is bestowed on the Queen's successor. Officially we common folk get some say in who that will be, but if you believe that, you're daft. Anyone with a dram of sense knows that the throne will go to the Queen's daughter, and to whoever is ruthless enough and lucky enough to wed her. Don't trouble your head about Royal politics, Jack,' Germaise adds, giving his dough a vicious punch. 'It's far above the likes of you and me.'[subsequently][rp] 'it's no use worrying about Royal politics; it's nothing to do with the lives of common folk.'[only]"

GE12 is a quip. The menu text is "'What did you think of the old Duke?'". The display text is "[first time]'It's only been a couple of years since the old Duke died,' you say. 'Do you miss him?'[paragraph break]Germaise gets a faraway look in his eyes. 'Ah, Duke Toresal,' he mutters, 'there was a bright and honorable Lord. He'd have been in line for the throne himself if he hadn't married below his station. And if he hadn't died.' He sighs. 'Eh, well. Those were better days, Jack.'[subsequently][rp] 'he was a good man who died before his time.'[only]"

Maybe I'll send her a few pastries as a gift, so she knows I'm thinking about her...'"

GE14 is a quip. The menu text is "'The mercenaries roughed Teisha up.'".

Part 3 - In Old Man Holstenoffer's Butcher's Shop

Chapter 1 - Description and scenery

The Butchers Shop is a store, north of Commerce Street. "Chains of linked sausages and thick, red cuts of meat dangle from hooks in the ceiling, and trays of less identifiable bits sit out on the counters. It's better than some butcheries you've seen, but it's still not your favorite place in the city. You can leave to the south."

Outside from the butchers shop is Commerce Street.

Instead of facing outside while in the Butchers Shop, try facing south.
The dead-end description of the Butchers Shop is "You can see no other exits besides the door to the south, leading to Commerce Street."

Instead of smelling the Butchers Shop, say "The store is filled with the thick, bloody smell of raw meat."

A counter 2 is privately-named, scenery. The counter 2 is in the Butchers Shop. The printed name is "counter".

Some trays are scenery and merchandise and on counter 2. The description is "The sausage looks tasty enough, and the hanging meat cuts would probably look good once they're cooked. The rest of it just makes you sort of ill."

Understand "tray", "meat", "sausage", "sausages", "carcass", "carcasses", "bits", "tray of", "bargain bits", "bargains", "counter", "gristle", "label", "labeled/labelled", "hanging", "hung", "cut/cuts", "chop/chops", "joint/joints", "raw" as the trays. The printed name is "trays of meat".

Instead of eating, tasting or smelling the trays:
	say "For some reason, this place just kills your appetite."

Instead of searching the trays:
	try examining the trays;

Some hooks are scenery, in the Butchers Shop. The description is "Dozens of thick, brutal hooks hang from the ceiling."

Instead of doing something other than examining to the hooks: say "The hooks are out of your reach.";

Understand "thick", "brutal", "hook" as the hooks.

A chopping block is scenery, in the Butchers Shop. The description is "Holstenoffer's chopping block is cut from a single, gigantic piece of unstained oak. Its surface is stained black with blood, soaked three inches down into the wood's grain."

Understand "stain", "stains", "stained", "oak", "oaken", "wood", "wooden", "gigantic", "unstained", "black", "grain", "board", "cutting", "butcher block/board", "butchers block/board" as the chopping block.

Instead of doing something to the chopping block,
	say "The chopping block is behind the counter, out of your reach — and honestly, you prefer it that way.";

Chapter 2 - Old Man Holstenoffer

Old Man Holstenoffer is a man and here. "Old Man Holstenoffer is leaning over his huge, bloodstained butcher block behind the counter, hacking up some carcass." The description is "Holstenoffer is a squat brick of a man, with a scarred bulldog's face and sailors['] tattoos covering his arms from the wrists all the way up to his rolled-up sleeves. He's friendly enough and loves to gossip, but he has a tendency to gesticulate with his cleaver in hand, which sometimes makes conversation with him a tense and athletic affair." Understand "butcher", "proprietor", "shopkeeper", "shop keeper", "merchant", "tattooed", "scarred", "scars", "scar", "squat", "brick", "of", "of a", "face", "friendly", "rolled", "rolled up", "sleeve", "sleeves" as Holstenoffer.

Instead of kissing Holstenoffer, say "You like Holstenoffer, but you don't like him [i]that[r] much."

Old Man Holstenoffer carries a cleaver. The description of the cleaver is "Holstenoffer calls his cleaver 'Big Molly,' and often talks to it as though it were a pet. The side of the blade is tarnished and dull from years of use, but the edge is sharp enough to hack through thick muscle and bone like they were pudding." Understand "big molly", "molly", "knife", "tarnished", "dull", "edge", "sharp" as the cleaver.

Some tattoos are part of Old Man Holstenoffer. The description is "Holstenoffer's tattoos are a solid blue tangle of swirling designs, covering his arms from his wrists all the way up to his rolled-up sleeves."  Understand "tattoo", "solid", "blue", "tangle", "design", "designs", "swirling", "arm", "arms", "sailors" as the tattoos.

Every turn when the player is not on the move and Holstenoffer is nearby and a random chance of 1 in 5 succeeds:
	say "[one of]Holstenoffer's cleaver cuts through a particularly tough joint with a gristly, crunching sound.[or]Holstenoffer chops deftly at the raw meat on his block, cutting into narrow strips.[or]Holstenoffer stops to wipe his hands on his blood-smeared apron.[or]Holstenoffer stops suddenly and holds up a slippery-looking chunk of red gristle. 'Huh,' he mutters, 'never seen one of [i]those[r] before.' With a shrug, he tosses it into a tray labeled 'Bargain Bits.'[at random]"

Chapter 3 - Event on entry

	continue the action;

Chapter 5 - Conversation

Section 1 - Initial conversation

Rule for initiating conversation with Old Man Holstenoffer:
	change the chosen opening gambit to HO12;

[HO1 is a quip: see Germaise's Conversation, above.] The display text of HO1 is "Holstenoffer glances over his shoulder as you come in. 'Ey, Jack!' he calls. 'Long time, no see. Bobby was around this morning, looking for yeh. Up to something again, eh?' he laughs."

HO2 is a quip. The menu text is "'What did Bobby want?'". The display text is "[first time]'Bobby was looking for me?' you ask, trying to contain your excitement. 'Did he say what he wanted?'[paragraph break]Holstenoffer shrugs. 'Didn't say. He said he'd be waiting for you over by Lord's Market. Yeh oughtta stick by Bobby more, Jack,' he adds. 'Big strong lad, he is; do a skinny boy like yerself good to learn from him.'[subsequently][rp] 'you'll have to ask him yerself. He's somewhere around Lord's Market, east of here.'[only]"

HO3 is a quip. The menu text is "'Heard any gossip?'". The display text is "[first time]'So, heard any good gossip lately, Holstenoffer?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Well, the mercenaries in Grubber's have got everyone excited,' Holstenoffer says, 'but I expect they'll be old news by tomorrow. Aside from that, all anyone talks about is the upcoming Ascension, yeh know.'[subsequently][rp] 'mercenaries and the Ascension are all anyone's talking about.'[only]"

HO4 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you know about the mercenaries in Grubber's?'". The display text is "[first time]'Have you heard about the mercenaries in Grubber's Market this morning?' you ask.[paragraph break]Holstenoffer's eyes narrow. 'All I know about mercs is, they're filthy scavengers to a man, with empty purses where their sense of honor oughtta be. Let [']em try coming up Commerce Street,' he growls, tightening his grip on his cleaver, 'They'll find more than some timid stallkeeper here!'[subsequently][rp] 'all I know is they'd better not come into my shop.'[only]"

HO5 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think about Baron Fossville?'". The display text is "[first time]'So tell us what you [i]really[r] think of Baron Fossville,' you say, smiling at Hostenoffer's earlier impression.[paragraph break]The butcher's face suddenly grows dark, and his cleaver [i]thwacks[r] into the wooden block. 'Tell yeh the truth Jack, I laugh about it when I can, but the Baron's a rat and I'm not afraid to say it. He don't care about this city, he don't care for anything but his own purse and his own power, and he ain't half the lord the old Duke was. He and the old Duke were always at odds, yeh know. But Fossville won that quarrel, and not by playing fair, I'd wager.' Holstenoffer shakes his cleaver menacingly. 'It makes a man so angry, he's liable to cut his own hand off if he's not careful.'[subsequently][rp] 'Fossville's a rat and everyone knows it.'[only]"

HO6 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of the Queen?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you think of the Queen?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Bah,' spits Holstenoffer, 'that old bat couldn't rule so much as her own temper. This whole kingdom went to pot when she took the throne, and we'll be even worse off if she gets to decide who takes the throne after her.'[subsequently][rp] 'her Royal Highness is an idiot. She'll run this kingdom into the ground before she's through.'[only]"

HO7 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of the Princess?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you think of the Princess?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Well, the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree, yeh know,' grumbles Holstenoffer. 'I figure if the Ascension goes to the Queen's little brat, it'll be just like she never left.'[subsequently][rp] 'I just hope the nobles can decide on someone better to rule this kingdom.'[only]"

HO8 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of the Ascension?'". The display text is "[first time]'What's your opinion of the upcoming Ascension?' you ask. 'Who do you think will take the throne?'[paragraph break]Holstenoffer heaves a sigh and spreads his arms in a wide shrug (forcing you to duck as a bit of bloody suet flies off the end of his cleaver and [i]splats[r] against the wall). 'I'm just a humble butcher, Jack. I know chopping meat, not Royal politics. But I do know that Fossville has his eye on the Queen's daughter, and that means his eye is on the throne, and [i]that[r] means no good for anyone. Yeh know what I think?' he asks, squinting at you and pointing with his cleaver. 'Old Holstenoffer thinks we're all doomed. That's what I think.'[subsequently][rp] 'it's all about who marries the Queen's daughter. Too depressing to think about, really.'[only]"

HO9 is a quip. The menu text is "'What did you think of the old Duke?'". The display text is "[first time]'I guess you liked the old Duke better, huh?' you ask.[paragraph break]Holstenoffer takes a deep breath. 'It's hard for someone your age to understand, Jack,' he says. 'Duke Toresal was a great man. A great, great man.' He starts chopping furiously, as if trying to hide a sudden rush of emotion.[subsequently][rp] 'the old Duke was a great man.'[only]"

HO10 is a quip. The menu text is "'Where did you get the tattoos?'". The display text is "[first time]'Holstenoffer,' you ask, 'where did you get those tattoos?'[paragraph break]Holstenoffer looks proudly down at his arms. 'Got these during my days at sea,' he said. 'I was quite the old salty dog, yeh know, before I came back to the city to be a meat chopper.' Then he frowns. 'Never did get the hang of it, though,' he admits. 'Kept gettin['] seasick. Still, the tattoos are quite the conversation piece, they are.'[subsequently][rp] 'got [']em when I was a sailor.'[only]"

HO11 is a quip. The menu text is "'Thanks.'". The display text is "'Thanks, Holstenoffer,' you say.[paragraph break]'Always a pleasure,' he says, bringing his cleaver down with a crunch."

HO12 is a quip. The menu text is "'Can I ask you something?'". The display text is "'Mind if I ask you a question?' you say.[paragraph break]'Go right ahead,' says Holstenoffer."

HO13 is a quip. The menu text is "'Never mind.'". The display text is "'Nah, never mind, it was nothing.'[paragraph break]'Suit yourself,' Holstenoffer says with a shrug."

HO14 is a quip. The display text is "'Say, Jack,' says Holstenoffer suddenly, 'I haven't seen Widow Shannon down this way in a few days. Everything all right at Maiden House?'"

HO15 is a quip. The menu text is "'She's fine; she's just been busy.'". The display text is "'Oh, everything's fine at Maiden House,' you say, while thinking to yourself, [i]and boring as ever[r]. 'Widow Shannon's just been busy; she hasn't had time to do the shopping.'[paragraph break]'Well, tell her I've been savin['] some choice cuts for her next time she comes down here. Good meat, better than she'll get in Grubber's, and cheaper too. Those orphans need to eat healthy.' He grins. 'And I need to convince Widow Shannon that I'd make her a good husband.'"

HO16 is a quip. The menu text is "'I try to stay away from Maiden House.'". The display text is "You try to stifle a groan. 'To tell you the truth, Holstenoffer, I try to stay away from Maiden House whenever I can.'[paragraph break]Holstenoffer smiles knowingly. 'The widows breathin['] down yer neck a bit, eh? Well, I know all about that. Plenty a['] times I sneaked outta the bedroom window when I was a wee lad stayin['] with me aunty. Still,' he waves his cleaver at you admonishingly, and you step back quickly to avoid a deep facial scar. 'Still, Maiden House is a good place for urchins like yerself. Keeps yeh outta trouble. And the widows are a fine bunch of women. [i]Especially[r] that Shannon,' he adds, with a wistful look in his eye."

HO17 is a quip. The menu text is "'She's just not into you, Holstenoffer.'". The display text is "You sigh. 'You know, I've told you before, Widow Shannon isn't looking for a husband. It's nothing against you personally, I think she just likes devoting all her time to the orphans.'[paragraph break]Holstenoffer just smiles. 'Oh, I know, Jack, that's what she [i]says[r]. But old Holstenoffer knows a few tricks too, yeh know.' He waves his cleaver in the air nonchalantly; a bit of bloody gristle dangles from the blade's tip. 'You just get her down here, and let Holstenoffer work his charm.'[paragraph break]You know from past experience that there's no use arguing with him about this, so you just smile and nod. 'I'll let her know,' you say."

Section 2 - Later conversation

HO18 is a quip. The display text is "Holstenoffer looks up as you enter his shop[first time], and his eyes widen. 'Goddesses, Jack,' he says, 'you look like you've had the worse of it.

HO19 is a quip. The menu text is "'Have you seen Bobby?'". The display text is "'Have you seen Bobby since last night?' you ask desperately.

'Um, no, no trouble,' you say. 'I'm just looking for him, is all.'[paragraph break]Holstenoffer sets his mouth in a grim line. It's clear he doesn't believe you, but Holstenoffer's never been one to pry. 'All right, then,' he says."

HO21 is a quip. The menu text is "'Yes, he's been captured by Fossville's men.'". The display text is "'It was Fossville!' you blurt out before you can stop to think whether you should. 'His mercenaries captured Bobby and me in the woods north of town... I got away, but Bobby's still in jail.'[paragraph break]Holstenoffer's jaw clenches and he shakes his head. 'Aw, stupid, brave lad. And that rotten Fossville. I'm so sorry, Jack. If I can do anything for yeh, just tell me, all right?'"

HO22 is a quip. The menu text is "'Is there a back door here?'". The display text is "[first time]'Listen, is there a back door in your shop?' you ask, craning to see around Holstenoffer's huge frame.[paragraph break]'Yeah...' he says slowly, giving you an odd look. 'Don't lead to nothin['] but a closed-off alley, though. What do yeh want back there for?'[subsequently][rp] 'there's an alley in back. But yer not goin['] back there until you tell me what yer doin['].'[only]"

HO23 is a quip. The menu text is "'Just let me back there.'". The display text is "'Please, Holstenoffer,' you say, 'just let me back there.'[paragraph break]He looks you square in the eye.

If you want me to help yeh, yer gonna have to tell me what's going on."

HO24 is a quip. The menu text is "'It's to help Bobby.'". The display text is "You take a deep breath. 'I need to get up onto the rooftops, so I can get to... a place.' You're not sure if Holstenoffer would actually [i]disapprove[r] of breaking into Fossville's house, in principle, but he probably wouldn't approve of you doing it yourself. 'Please, Holstenoffer. I need to get up there to help Bobby.'[paragraph break]Holstenoffer looks at you for a few moments, then nods his head. 'All right then. Come around the counter here.'[paragraph break]You follow the burly butcher to the back of his shop, where he unlocks and opens a small metal door. 'Be safe now, Jack,' he says, laying a thick hand on your shoulder. 'Do what yeh have to do.'[paragraph break]A twinge of guilt nags at you. Technically, you don't have any idea whether this letter will help Bobby or not, although you certainly [i]hope[r] it does. But what else can you do? 'Thanks,' you whisper, and step through the door."

Part 4 - Armory

Chapter 1 - Description and scenery

The armory shop is a store, northeast of Commerce Street. The description of the armory is "The tangy smell of oiled steel is nearly overpowering in this small, windowless shop.

However, there is a display of assorted knives and daggers sitting out where you can get a close look at them." The printed name is "Armory".

South of the armory shop is Commerce Street.

Outside from the armory shop is Commerce Street.

'Hurry up and buy something, Jacqueline,' Pieter says.[end if]" instead;

Chapter 2 - Olgan Minor

Section 1 - Description of Olgan

Olgan Minor is a man and here. "Olgan Minor, the proprietor, leans against the counter, watching you intently." The description is "Olgan Minor is short but muscular, with a lined face and graying, military-cut hair.

Understand "proprietor", "shopkeeper", "shop keeper", "merchant", "man" as Olgan Minor.

You've already terrified him.'[paragraph break]The man — you realize now that he must be Baron Fossville, Lord of the city since the old Duke died, and one of the most powerful nobles in Toresal — eyes you suspiciously. Even flustered, his sharp features are intense, handsome, and dangerously intelligent. His lips twitch slightly beneath his trim moustache. Finally, he releases you.[paragraph break]'Off with you then, urchin,' he growls, flicking his fingers as though he had just touched something filthy. 'Take your begging elsewhere, and learn to stay out from under the feet of your betters.'[paragraph break]Fossville strides off towards Commerce Street, followed closely by his hooded companion. As she brushes past you, you can hear her talking in a low voice, '...have the money you need, but we must be subtle about it.

'This will be [i]just[r] a moment,' he calls over his shoulder.[paragraph break]You look at Pieter and shrug.[paragraph break]'Er, I'll wait outside,' he says.[paragraph break]And afterwards, as you look at yourself in the full-length mirror while the clothier kneels at your feet, tugging, plucking, pinning, making adjustments, you realize that he was right — you [i]do[r] look like a princess.";

In fact, I [i]guarantee[r] that if you wear one of my dresses to the ball, [i]no one[r] is going to take their eyes off you.

He gives you a slight smile and nod when you catch his eye.[otherwise]It looks as though they worked him over pretty hard before tying him up. His wrists and ankles are all bound together behind his back, the ropes digging cruelly into his skin.[end if]". Understand "guard", "man" as Pieter.

The initial appearance of Pieter is "[if caught]Pieter is lying on the floor in front of the fire place, trussed up and gagged.[otherwise if the Bodyguard Scene has not happened]Pieter stands discreetly near the back of the room.[otherwise]Pieter is here, [one of]looking around warily[or]fingering his sword hilt[or]muttering to himself[or]shifting his feet impatiently[or]keeping a close eye on you[at random][end if]";

Instead of talking to Pieter when the Bodyguard scene has not happened:
	say "'I can't really talk while I'm on duty, Jack,' says Pieter. 'Maybe later.'";

Instead of kissing Pieter:
	if the location is the War Room, say "Pieter seems a little preoccupied at the moment.";
	otherwise say "You like Pieter, but you don't like him [i]that[r] much."

To say Jack stutteringly:
	say "[one of]Jack[or]Jacqueline[or]Jac— er, Jacqueline[at random]";

Chapter 3 - Dame Sandler

Dame Sandler is a woman, scenery, in the Jewelers shop. The initial appearance is "Dame Sandler stands near the central display case. A small, dignified smile plays on her lips." The description is "Though in her elder years, Dame Sandler is still a tall and striking woman. Her long, silver hair is pulled back in a complicated bun, and she has a habit of inspecting her merchandise through a monocle on the end of a long, slender, gold-filigreed handle. Sometimes you wonder what she's doing running a shop (even such a relatively high-class one as this); her demeanor is more that of an aristocrat, if not full royalty[first time].[paragraph break]Although you almost never come to her shop (everything in here is too expensive to buy and too well-guarded to nick), for some reason Dame Sandler has always taken a liking to you, and never runs you out when you visit, even when she has important customers to tend to. It's more of a bemused curiosity than real affection, but feels good to be on a friendly basis with such an intriguing woman[only].";

Understand "woman", "proprietor", "shopkeeper", "shop keeper", "merchant" as Dame Sandler.

Instead of kissing Dame Sandler, say "Although you're pretty sure that Dame Sandler likes you, she doesn't seem like the affectionate type."

DS1 is a quip. The display text is "Dame Sandler's eyebrows raise slightly as you walk into her store.

You look a bit out of breath — nothing ails you, I hope?'"

DS2 is a quip. The menu text is "'No, I'm fine.'". The display text is "'No, I'm fine,' you say.[paragraph break]'I [i]see[r],' says Dame Sandler, in a tone that suggests she doesn't believe you, but doesn't have any particular objection to you lying.[paragraph break]'Well then, young man,' she continues after a brief pause, 'Was there anything in particular on your mind?'"

DS3 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'There were mercenaries chasing me this morning.'". The display text is "'There were mercenaries chasing me all over Grubber's Market this morning,' you admit. 'I guess I'm still a bit shaken up.'"
The following quip of DS3 is DS6;

DS4 is a quip. The menu text is "'Have you seen Bobby?'". The display text is "[first time]'Have you seen Bobby around?' you ask, trying to make it sound casual.[paragraph break]'Ah, Bobby,' says Dame Sandler with a knowing smile. 'Now there's a boy a who could get you into all sorts of the most... [i]interesting[r] sorts of trouble. Why yes,' she adds. 'I have seen him. He was wandering around the south end of the square, just by the alley.'[subsequently][rp] 'Bobby is in the alley just south of Lord's Market. Do pay attention, dear.'[only]"

DS5 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Have you heard about the mercenaries?'". The display text is "'Did you hear about the mercenaries in Grubber's Market this morning?' you ask."
The following quip of DS5 is DS6;

DS6 is a quip. The display text is "'Ah yes, I [i]did[r] hear about that nasty business in Grubber's Market,' Dame Sandler says. 'How terrible. Odd, the way they seemed so interested in you.'"

The following quip of DS9 is DS10;

DS10 is a quip. The display text is "'Only that there seems to be no conceivable reason for a group of trained soldiers to be hunting for an orphan of no significant heritage. Questions spring to mind, such as: who hired them? And why now in particular? And is everything about this incident what it seems to be?'[paragraph break]Dame Sandler smiles at you. She doesn't seem to be actually asking you these questions, so much as hinting to you that she already knows the answers."

DS11 is a quip. The menu text is "'I don't know what you're talking about.'". The display text is "Suddenly Dame Sandler's knowing tone starts to seem a little bit creepy. 'I don't know what you're talking about,' you say, cautiously. 'Those mercenaries chasing me were just a coincidence.'[paragraph break]Dame Sandler smiles. 'Of course they were, my dear Jack. Of course they were.'"

DS12 is a quip. The menu text is "'Thanks! I should go.'". The display text is "'Thanks!' you say, not quite able to hide your enthusiasm. 'I should probably go find him...'[paragraph break]Dame Sandler smiles. 'Of course, Squire Jack. Don't let me keep you.'"

DS14 is a quip. The display text is "Just as you're about to leave, Dame Sandler calls out, 'Oh, Jack, I almost forgot to ask you... what are your thoughts on the coming Ascension?'"

DS15 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'I don't know anything about it.'". The display text is "You shrug. 'I don't know anything about it. It's all over my head, really.'[paragraph break]'Oh, but it's really very simple,' says Dame Sandler. 'The King — or Queen, in this case — chooses her successor for the throne, usually her direct, lineal descendant, although technically she can choose anyone. Unless [i]someone else[r] has a valid claim to the throne. Then it becomes very, very complicated.'"
The following quip of DS15 is DS18;

DS16 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'It seems like it's going to fall to the Princess.'". The display text is "'It seems like a done deal, from what I've heard,' you say. 'The Princess will take the throne, and I guess Baron Fossville if she consents to marry him.'[paragraph break]Dame Sandler shakes her head. 'It's never a [']done deal['], Jack, not until the crown is finally placed on someone's head — and sometimes not even then. The throne is the greatest prize in all the kingdom, and no one with any stake in it can afford to let it be a forgone conclusion.'"
The following quip of DS16 is DS18;

DS17 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Why should I care?'". The display text is "You shrug. 'What is it to me? That sort of thing is way beyond us common folk, isn't it?'[paragraph break]'Tsk, tsk, Jack,' Dame Sandler sighs. 'Such cynicism in youth is unattractive.'"
The following quip of DS17 is DS18;

DS18 is a quip. The display text is "She smiles in that knowing way of hers. 'Some friendly advice, Jack: the Ascension is the most important event you will witness in your lifetime. It would behoove you to understand more about it. You should ask around; you might be surprised at some of the answers you get.'[paragraph break]Then she gives a little wave. 'On your way, then.'"

DS19 is a quip. The display text is "'Can I ask you a question, Dame Sandler?' you ask.[paragraph break]'But of course, my dear Jack,' she says."

DS20 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of Baron Fossville?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you think of  Baron Fossville?' you ask.[paragraph break]Dame Sandler smirks. 'Fossville is a buffoon, of course, but he is a buffoon with the backing of some very powerful people and a large number of hired swords. He's not one to trifle with lightly. Of course, I [i]never[r] do anything lightly,' she adds, smiling enigmatically.[subsequently][rp] 'Fossville is a powerful man and not one to be trifled with, whatever your opinions of him.'[only]"

DS21 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of the Queen?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you think of the Queen?' you ask.[paragraph break]'The Queen may be a poor ruler,' Dame Sandler says, 'but she is a shrewd politician. She backs Fossville for now, but she will snip him off like a loose thread if she deems it advantageous.'[subsequently][rp] 'the Queen will support Baron Fossville as long as it's to her advantage, and not a moment longer.'[only]"

DS22 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of the Princess?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you think of the Princess?' you ask.[paragraph break]Dame Sandler shrugs. 'The Princess has as much riding on the Ascension as Fossville does,' she says. 'Can you blame her? This is her chance to become Queen of Miradania, after all. If you had that sort of opportunity, wouldn't you do anything in your power to grasp it?' And she smiles again, strangely.[subsequently][rp] 'the Princess wants her chance to be Queen. Just as I imagine any girl of her age and position would.'[only]"

DS23 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you know about the Ascension?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you know about the Ascension?' you ask.[paragraph break]Dame Sandler merely arches one eyebrow and smiles at you. 'Why, what do you think about it, Jack?'[subsequently]Dame Sandler waves the question away. 'I've already told you all you need to know, Jack. What you learn from that is up to you.'[only]"

I'm sorry.'[paragraph break]Seeing the look of desperation on your face, Dame Sandler continues, 'Did Bobby give you any... instructions... before you were separated?"

DS27 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'No.'". The display text is "Something about her question triggers your suspicions, and you pause. 'No,' you say, forcing your voice to sound level and calm. 'He didn't give me any instructions.'[paragraph break]Dame Sandler nods slowly. 'Well then, Squire Jack, you appear to be out of options. The wisest course of action probably would be to find a place to hide... and stay there.'"
The following quip is DS29.

DS28 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'He told me to break into Baron Fossville's house and steal a letter.'".

'He told me there's an alley behind the shops on Commerce Street where I can climb up to the rooftops; then I'm to break into Baron Fossville's house, and steal a… a letter.'[paragraph break]Dame Sandler's eyebrows arch and she inclines her head slightly. 'A [i]letter[r],' she murmurs. 'How interesting. Well then, Squire Jack, I suppose you had better get to it. The shops on Commerce Street most likely will have back doors leading to the alley; one of them is sure to grant you access if you ask.'"
The following quip is DS29.

DS29 is a quip. The display text is "She stands up and moves over to the door. 'And now, my dear boy, I'm afraid I must ask you to leave.

The description is "It's in some ways fortunate that you're not on a first-name basis with these fellows, because you'd never be able to tell them apart.

In short, anything that...'[paragraph break]'...would help assure us that we were making...'[paragraph break]'...a sound [i]investment[r].'[subsequently]'As we told you before,' they say, 'there are many different sorts. But a letter would be most ideal.'[only]"

The display text is "The two brothers lean forward eagerly, as though they've been waiting for you to ask.[paragraph break]'We would be [i]delighted[r] to extend to you...'[paragraph break]'...our most prestigious line of credit!'[paragraph break]Over the next few minutes they hand you dozens of sheets of paper covered in dense, tiny script, full of bizarre words like [i]amortization[r], [i]compound interest[r], and [i]escrow[r]. Pieter tries to read some of it, with his brow furrowed up and his lips moving slightly; eventually he shakes his head and mutters, 'Just sign all of them.' You dutifully write your name where the brothers show you.[paragraph break]After it's all done, they sweep all the papers into a slim leather folder, and place a small purse of coins on the counter. 'That's [i]it?[r]' complains Pieter, but when you tug open the drawstring, you see the sunlight gleam of gold.[paragraph break]'When you have secured your position, please remember us...' says one brother.[paragraph break]'...not merely as your creditors...'[paragraph break]'...but as your [i]friends[r].'[paragraph break]And both brothers smile in unison, revealing two sets of wide, white teeth."

'We have the utmost...' one of them begins.[paragraph break]'...[no line break][i]respect[r] for Baron Fossville,' continues the other. 'However, he presents certain...'[paragraph break]'...[no line break][i]liabilities[r]. Let us leave it at that.'[subsequently]They shake their heads.

Instead of taking the gold coins:

'Go on, take a look.'[paragraph break]The little boy, his eyes wide and solid, reaches out and pries Bobby's fingers open. His hand is empty. The little boy looks dismayed.[paragraph break]'Ah, but what's this?' asks Bobby. And he reaches forward and draws a copper coin from behind the boy's grimy ear. A collective gasp, then squeals of delight from the rest of the children, and the little boy's eyes look ready to fall out of his head.[paragraph break]Bobby presses the coin into the little boy's hand, then passes out more coins to the others. 'Here,' he says, 'keep it safe in your pocket. Spend it on bread, not candy.' The children take their prizes and scatter.[paragraph break]";

		if the location is not in Greater Lord's Keep:

He's an orphan, like you, and like you he makes the streets of the city his home and lives by his wits. Unlike you, he doesn't have the safety net of Maiden House to fall back on, but somehow he always seems to do well for himself.[paragraph break]You also happen to think that he's devastatingly handsome, although you would never admit that under the worst torture the King's interrogators could devise. He doesn't even know that you're really a girl, and you're not about to tell him, because if he knew he would certainly stop inviting you along on his exploits";

Instead of kissing Bobby:
	if the location is the War Room, say "Bobby is a little busy right now!";

BO2 is a quip. The menu text is "'Nothing much.'". The display text is "'Oh, nothing much,' you say. 'Just, you know... doing stuff. Around the city. Staying tricky.'[paragraph break]'Huh,' says Bobby, nodding vaguely.[paragraph break][i]Goddesses[r], you think to yourself, [i]I am such a dim![no line break][r]"

BO3 is a quip. The menu text is "'I was chased by some mercenaries.'". The display text is "'Oh, nothing much,' you say, nonchalantly. 'Unless you count being chased by armed mercenaries through Grubber's Market.'[paragraph break]Bobby grins and snaps his fingers. 'Oh, I [i]heard[r] about that! Extra tricky! Wish I could've been there to help; that would've been a time!'[paragraph break]You look away, wondering if it's obvious, the way you're totally glowing right now."

BO4 is a quip. The menu text is "'What's with the urchins?'". The display text is "'So what’s with all the urchins I saw you with?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Oh, I just got lucky this morning,' Bobby says. 'Some dim was striding around Lord's Market with his purse strings too loose, so I stopped and tightened them for him. By the time I'd finished, he'd already left. So I thought I'd share the wealth.' He sighs and looks uncharacteristically glum. 'They have so little...' he murmurs, then shakes his head. 'Anyway.'"

BO5 is a quip. The menu text is "'Were you at Maiden House?'". The display text is "'I don't usually see you on this side of town,' you remark. 'Were you visiting Maiden House?' You try to make it sound casual, but inside you're practically holding your breath. Because if Bobby was visiting Maiden House, theat means he was coming to visit [i]you[r].[paragraph break]'Nah, not for me, that place,' says Bobby. 'You know how the Widows are, they'd just mother-hen me to death. I can't be cooped up; there's too many things to do, places to see. Trinkets to nick.' He laughs, then glances at you. 'But you know, it's all right for someone younger, like you. Good to have a shelter, somewhere you can run back to when things get sticky.'[paragraph break]You feel your neck growing hot. 'I don't need to [i]run[r] anywhere,' you mutter. You [i]hate[r] it when he brings up your age. He's only two years older than you, anyway![paragraph break]Bobby looks embarrassed. 'Er, yeah, yeah, I know that, Jack,' he says. 'Sorry, mate. I didn't mean anything by it. Let's change the subject.'"

BO6 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'What did you want to see me for?'". The display text is "'So, I heard you were looking for me,' you say. 'What'd you want to tell me?'[paragraph break]Bobby grins.". The following quip is BO8.

BO7 is a transitional quip. The display text is "'Wait, wait,' Bobby says, catching your arms. 'There was something I wanted to tell you.'". The following quip is BO8.

BO8 is a quip. The display text is "He makes a show of looking carefully over one shoulder, then the other, then leans close to whisper. 'I found this new place, right? It's a big secret, extra tricky. I was thinking of doing a bit of exploring there later tonight. You want to come with?' He smiles that knowing half-smile of his, the one that always means he's about to do something that will be very fun, or land you both in a pile of trouble, or — the usual case — both."

BO9 is a quip. The menu text is "'Where is this place?'". The display text is "'I don't know,' you say. 'Where is this place?'[paragraph break]Bobby rolls his eyes. 'Well, that's kind of the point, if I told you, it would ruin the secret. C'mon, Jack, are you in or out?'"

BO10 is a quip. The menu text is "'I'm in.'". The display text is "Could you [i]even[r] consider saying no? 'Okay, let's do it,' you say, your heart thumping hard. 'I'm in.'[paragraph break]'You're a good bloke, Jack,' says Bobby. 'Now, you don't want the Maidens worrying about you, so head on home for now. Once it gets dark, sneak back out and meet me in the Grubber's Market. Right? Good. See you later, Jack.' He claps his hand on your shoulder, then turns and strides, all grace and overconfidence, out of the alley."

BO11 is a quip. The menu text is "'Can I ask you a question?'". The display text is "'Hey, Bobby, you mind if I ask you a question?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Sure,' says Bobby."

BO12 is a quip. The menu text is "'Do you know anything about the mercenaries?'". The display text is "[first time]'Do you know anything about those mercenaries that were chasing me?' you ask.[paragraph break]Bobby shakes his head. 'Sorry, Jack. I was all the way on the other side of town when it happened. Word on the street is, they were looking for someone important. What that has to do with you, I have no idea.'[paragraph break]'Oh, [i]thanks[r],' you say, punching him in the arm.[subsequently][rp] 'I don't know anything.'[only]"

BO14 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think about Baron Fossville?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you think about Baron Fossville?' you ask.[paragraph break]Bobby shrugs. 'I try not to. He's a little man who cares more about his power than about the people in this city. But then, most of them are like that, aren't they?'[subsequently][rp] 'he's just another politician.'[only]"

BO15 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you know about the Ascension'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you know about this Ascension thing?' you ask.[paragraph break]Bobby looks at you incredulously. 'Ascension? Well, I know a little...' He takes a deep breath, as though gathering his thoughts. 'Okay, so, the King died without naming any heir, right? I don't know why he didn't just name his own daughter, but he didn't. And that makes things interesting, because now that means the people get a say. Well... [i]important people[r], mainly, the Dukes and Barons and whatnot, but even the common blokes like you and me get represented by a People's Regent who gets a bit of a say. And the thing is, the Queen's never been all that popular. She wants to keep the succession in the bloodline, and all the Dukes and Barons want someone who's going to keep the treasuries filled, and the People's Regent is going to be pulling for a good-looking hero type who looks out for the poor, or pretends to at least. And there's no obvious good choice. So now basically everything's up for grabs.'[paragraph break]He turns red when he notices you staring at him. 'Or at least, uh, that's what I hear.'[subsequently]'Come on, Jack,' Bobby says, rolling his eyes, 'I already explained it once. Any more and my throat will dry out.'[only]"

There's no sign, but you know it well nonetheless — this is the door to Maiden House, your 'home'[or]The door to Maiden House is [if the wooden door is open]open[otherwise]closed[end if][stopping].";
	otherwise say "The front door is [if the wooden door is open]open.[otherwise]closed." 

The description of the wooden door is "There's nothing on the outside to distinguish Maiden House from any of the other run-down tenements in this neighborhood, but you recognize it well. You grew up in this place, and it is filled with memories both good and bad. Well, okay, mostly bad. But you make do with what you have."

Instead of examining the wooden door when the location is the Hallway:
	if Raid on Maiden House has not happened, say "The front door is closed and locked — and it will stay locked until sunup. The Maidens give you a good bit of latitude generally, but curfew is one of the few rules they never, ever bend.";

Chapter 2 - Widow Theresa

Section 1 - Description

Widow Theresa is a woman, scenery, in the Hallway. The description is "Widow Theresa is a harsh, sour-faced woman, with suspicious eyes and a mannish, angular jaw that she thrusts out when she is angry, which is nearly always. You gather that she was very poor before coming to Maiden House, and she harbors a bitter dislike for anyone whom she perceives as unjustly privileged. For reasons that persistently escape you, that includes you. Staying out of her way is generally the best tactic."

The long brass key is held by Widow Theresa. The description is "That's the key to the front door. Widow Theresa keeps it on a ribbon around her neck constantly." The printed name is "brass key". Understand "front door key" as the long brass key.

The ribbon is held by Widow Theresa. The description is "It's just a long piece of ribbon."

Instead of doing something other than examining when the noun is the long brass key or the noun is the ribbon:
	say "Widow Theresa has her eye on you constantly, and she won't let you get near [the noun].";

Instead of kissing Widow Theresa, say "That would surely be about as pleasant as hugging a cactus."

Section 2 - Conversation

TH2 is a quip. The menu text is "'And how are you this evening?'". The display text is "'And how are [i]you[r] this fine evening, Widow Theresa?' you say, dropping an exaggerated curtsey.[paragraph break]Her face twitches.

TH3 is a quip. The menu text is "'You can't lock me in!'". The display text is "'You can't lock me in here!' you shout. 'I'm supposed to meet Bobby tonight!'[paragraph break]Widow Theresa somehow manages to look both scandalized at the idea of you keeping a midnight tryst and pleased that she has managed to ruin your entire night already. (It's a look she practices often.) 'That Bobby is a bad influence,' she declares. 'You shouldn't be running amok with older boys in the first place, much less a delinquent like him.'"

TH4 is a quip. The menu text is "'Give me a break, I was chased by mercenaries this morning.'". The display text is "'Come on, Widow Theresa,' you say, 'give me a break. I'm tired; I was chased all over Grubber's Market by armed soldiers this morning.'[paragraph break]She smirks. 'An obvious lie,' she says, 'not up to your usual standards. And even if it were true, they were probably hired by someone you'd stolen from, and it would have served you right if you were caught.'"

TH5 is a quip. The menu text is "'Where are Fiona and Shannon?'". The display text is "You sigh. The last thing you need is to get drawn into another argument with Widow Theresa. 'Where are Widow Fiona and Widow Shannon?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Fiona is in the kitchen, washing the dishes,' she says, 'and Shannon is in the laundry room. Which is to say, they are actually doing something [i]productive[r], so you'll avoid them at all costs, I'm sure.'"

TH6 is a quip. The menu text is "'Let me ask you something.'". The display text is "'Let me ask you something,' you say.[paragraph break]Widow Theresa does not answer at first, but after a moment she glares at you sharply and says, '[i]What?[r]'"

TH7 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of Widow Fiona?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you think of Widow Fiona?' you ask.[paragraph break]Theresa looks at you for a long time before answering. 'I think,' she says, finally, 'that playing favorites does an injustice to the other children here, but in your case it's even worse because of how little you deserve it. Fiona thinks you're something special. But I think you're just a spoiled brat who thinks she can get away with whatever she likes. And I think that one day, you're going to be caught with your fingers in the wrong pocket, and then you will be very, very sorry.' She sneers and adds in a low voice, 'And I think I'm looking forward to that day.'[subsequently][rp] 'she treats you far better than you deserve.'[only]"

TH8 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of Widow Shannon?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you think of Widow Shannon?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Shannon?' laughs Theresa. 'I'd say she's too dim to catch a husband, but I'm not sure she even wants one. Don't worry, she'll still be here long after you're dead in a gutter somewhere.'[subsequently][rp] 'she's too dim to be anything but happy here.'[only]"

TH9 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of Baron Fossville?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you think of Baron Fossville?' you ask.[paragraph break]Widow Theresa gets a wistful look in her eye. 'Baron Fossville is a great man.

TH10 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you know about the Ascension?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you know about the Ascension?' you ask.[paragraph break]Widow Theresa sniffs. 'Royal politics are for people of breeding and intellect, which puts it far above your concern, I'm sure.'[subsequently][rp] 'it's not something you would understand.'[only]"

TH11 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you know about my parents?'". The display text is "'Widow Theresa,' you say suddenly, 'what do you know about my parents?' You're not quite sure why you asked the question; it's certainly never occurred to you to ask her before.[paragraph break]But as soon as the words leave your mouth, you realize your mistake. Widow Theresa would never let such a rich opportunity to hurt you pass unseized.[paragraph break]'I don't know much,' she says, 'but I can make an educated guess. No doubt your father was some vagrant, probably on the run from the law. Too shifty to stay around for [i]you[r], at any rate. As for your mother,' she goes on with a cruel smile, 'no one knows who she was, nor is anyone likely to ever learn. But women like that all tend to end up in the same place in the end, don't they?'[paragraph break]Your face is alternating burning hot and icy cold, and your fists are clenched to keep your hands from shaking. 'Well. Thanks,' you manage to whisper."

The table is a supporter, and scenery, in the Kitchen.

Older kids are encouraged to scrounge around the city for their meals rather than rely on the kitchen, but the Maidens make sure that no one goes hungry."

[ "The pots and pans are scenery, here" annoyingly gives us a pots object and a pans object.

The description is "[if the location is Kitchen]Fiona is a plump and genial woman, always quick with a smile or a bit of advice.

'Oh, Goddesses, Jacqueline, are you hurt?'"

FI4 is a quip. The menu text is "'Nah, I'm fine.'". The display text is "'Nah, it was tricky,' you say, feigning an insouciance that you don't really feel. 'Just a lot of people running around and yelling about nothing.'[paragraph break]Widow Fiona doesn't seem convinced, however. She checks you all over for injuries, muttering '[i]Goddesses... so close... could have been... all because of...[no line break][r]' Finally, after she's satisfied that you aren't secretly bleeding to death, she looks you directly in the eye.

FI5 is a quip. The menu text is "'A few bumps and scratches is all.'". The display text is "'A few bruises and scratches as I was getting away,' you say. 'Nothing serious.'

'It's all right now,' she whispers, 'you're safe now.' Then, after she checks you all over to for injuries and satisfies herself that you aren't secretly bleeding to death, she looks you directly in the eye.

Please, Jacqueline, promise me you'll stay away from Grubber's Market.'"

FI7 is a quip. The menu text is "'Yes ma'am.'". The display text is "'Yes, ma'am, I will,' you say. You know it's a promise you can't possibly keep, but you also know it will comfort Fiona to hear it.[paragraph break]She takes a deep breath. 'Thank you, Jacqueline.'"

You should listen to what he says... you might learn something important.'[paragraph break]Suddenly you remember the impossible situation that Widow Theresa has put you in. 'Oh, but Widow Theresa has locked me in for the night!' you cry. 'I'm supposed to meet Bobby later on!'". The following quip is FI10.

You can stay out all night if you like — although I wish you wouldn't — but once you're in and the evening bells ring, you're in. And I can't let you out after Widow Theresa's locked the doors for the night; it would undermine her authority.'[paragraph break]All you can do is seethe. Just for once, it would be nice if the things Widow Theresa says about Fiona playing favorites with you were actually [i]true[r]."

FI15 is a quip. The menu text is "'Can I ask you a question?'". The display text is "'Do you mind if I ask you a question?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Of course not, dear,' Widow Fiona says."

FI16 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of Widow Theresa?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you think of Widow Theresa?' you ask, trying to keep the angry edge out of your voice.[paragraph break]'Widow Theresa can be prickly at times,' Fiona says, keeping her voice carefully neutral, 'but you must be patient with her. She's had a difficult life. Her late husband left her with a heavy debt, and she's never been able to forgive him for that.'[subsequently][rp] 'Theresa has a temper, but she has a good heart.'[only]"

FI17 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of Widow Shannon?'".

The display text is "[first time]'What do you think of Baron Fossville?' you ask.[paragraph break]Widow Fiona's expression hardens, which is not something that happens often.

You shouldn't concern yourself with him, Jacqueline.'[subsequently][rp] 'you needn't concern yourself with Baron Fossville.'[only]"

FI19 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you know about the Ascension?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you know about the Ascension?' you ask.[paragraph break]Fiona gives you an odd look. 'The Ascension?' she asks. 'What makes you ask?'[paragraph break]You shrug. 'It's just that I keep hearing about it. Everyone's talking about it, and everyone has a different opinion about it, and it seems terribly important, but I still don't understand it very much.'[paragraph break]She thinks for a moment, then says, 'The reason why everyone is talking about the Ascension is because it's the first time we've had one in a long time. There's no clear successor to the throne, and so everyone is in a tizzy about who has a solid claim and who will be chosen. Probably we'll have a People's Regent, and when the time comes I'll make my voice heard along with everyone else… but the truth is, Jacqueline, is that even with the Regent, people like you and me have very little say in what happens.'[subsequently][rp] 'it's a very important ceremony that only very important people have a say in.'[only]"

FI20 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you know about my parents?'". The display text is "[first time]'Can you tell me anything about my parents?' you ask.[paragraph break]Fiona looks at you, surprised. 'What brought that question on?'[paragraph break]'I don't really know,' you say, which for once is the unvarnished truth. 'I've just been thinking about them lately.'[paragraph break]She dries her hands off and puts a hand on your shoulder. 'We've told you before, your mother came to us and stayed only long enough to leave you on our doorstep. No one knows where she is now. As for your father...' She hesitates. 'The only thing I can tell you with absolute certainty is that he loved you very much. Your parents weren't bad people, Jacqueline, they were put in a hard circumstance and had to make a terrible sacrifice. You were never unwanted. Just... unfortunate.'[subsequently][rp] 'your parents loved you, Jacqueline.'[only]"

Part 6 - Privy

Chapter 1 - Description 

The Privy is southwest of the Hallway. "Not much more than a narrow closet, with a hole in the floor and a bench over it. At least it's more private than an alley."

Understand "narrow", "closet", "doorway", "bathroom", "water closet", "privies", "restroom", "toilet" as the privy. 

The privy overlooks Behind Maiden House.

Instead of facing west while in the Privy, try searching the privy window.
Instead of facing outside while in the Privy, try searching the privy window.

The distant description of the Privy is "[if the location is Hallway]The privy lies to the southwest[otherwise]You can't see much through the grimy window[end if]."

Does the player mean doing something with the Hallway when the location is the Privy: it is likely.

Instead of smelling the privy, try examining the hole.

Chapter 2 - Privy hole

A hole is a container and scenery, in the privy. The description is "The less said about that, the better."

Instead of searching, touching or smelling the hole, try examining the hole.

Before inserting something into the hole, say "You never know; you might want it back someday. Besides, the last thing you want is to accidentally clog that hole up." instead.

Before entering the hole, say "It's way too small for you to fit into. Thank the Goddesses." instead.

The bench is an enterable supporter, scenery, in the privy. The description is "The bench allows you to use the privy without a lot of ungainly squatting."

Instead of sitting on the bench,
	say "You don't feel the urge right now."; [TRAC: but what about standing on it?]

Chapter 3 - Window

The privy window is an open door, west of the privy, east of Behind Maiden House. "A narrow window over the bench provides some ventilation.". The description is "[if the location is the Privy]The window has been stuck halfway open for as long as you can remember. No one's ever bothered to fix it, because no matter how cold it gets, no one who's been in that privy would ever consider closing the window for even an instant. There's a bit less than two hand-widths of clearance between the pane and the sill — just enough for you to scrape through.[otherwise]The privy window is at ground level on the outside. Through the dirty glass, you can look down into the hole in the bathroom floor. Not that you'd want to.[end if]"

Outside from the Privy is the privy window. Inside from Behind Maiden House is the privy window.

Instead of opening or closing the privy window:
	let the verb be "close";
	if we are opening,
		let the verb be "open";
	say "[if the location is the privy]The window is adamantly stuck halfway; the pane won't budge an inch, up or down.[otherwise]You can't [verb] the window from the outside.[end if]"

Instead of going through the window when in Behind Maiden House:
	say "Although you've done so many times in the past, at the moment there's no need to sneak [i]into[r] Maiden House.";

Instead of searching the privy window, say "Through the window's grime-smeared glass, you can see [if the location is the Privy]the privy room inside Maiden House[otherwise]a tiny alleyway behind Maiden House[end if]."

After going to the privy:
	now the privy window is not scenery;
	continue the action;

After going to Behind Maiden House:
	now the privy window is scenery;
	continue the action;

Section 1 - Escaping from Maiden House

Instead of climbing the privy window, try entering the noun.

Before entering the privy window when in the privy:
	if the player is on the bench begin;
		move the player to the privy, without printing a room description;
	end if;
	say "[first time]You sneak a furtive glance back at the hallway, then step up onto the bench. It wobbles under your feet, and you grab the window sill to steady yourself.[paragraph break]Then, holding your breath to keep from making a sound, you pull yourself up and through. The window is at ground level outside, and you wriggle out onto the slick cobblestones.[paragraph break]You're free! Of course, the widows will find out you're gone soon enough — Maiden House is not a very big place, after all. But you've snuck out before, and they know you can take care of yourself. At worst, you'll pull extra laundry duty for a few days.[only]";

Part 7 - Laundry

Chapter 1 - Description and scenery

The Laundry is southeast of the Hallway. "The air in here is filled with steam and the sharp stink of lye soap. Moisture trickles down the walls, and puddles of water splash underfoot. The main hallway lies northwest."

Understand "washing", "wash" as the laundry.

The distant description of the Laundry is "[if the location is the Hallway]The laundry lies southeast of here[otherwise]The laundry is just outside[end if]."

Instead of smelling the laundry, say "The harsh soap the widows like to use has a strong smell that burns your nostrils."

After going to the Laundry for the first time:
	try looking;
	update the character list;
	start conversation with Widow Shannon on SH1;

After going from the Laundry when Widow Shannon is in the Laundry and Raid on Maiden House has not happened:
	say "'See you later, Widow Shannon,' you say as you leave.[paragraph break]Widow Shannon smiles at you over her shoulder. 'Take care, Jacqueline.'";
	continue the action;

A huge wooden washtub is a container, scenery, in the Laundry. The description is "The wooden tub is huge enough to bathe in (and it has been used for that purpose on occasion). It's slopping over with soap-clouded water, pouring steam into the humid air." Understand "wooden", "wood", "tub", "water", "laundry" as the washtub.

Instead of entering the washtub, say "You don't need a bath right now. And you [i]definitely[r] don't need a bath in [i]that[r]."

Instead of washing the player in the presence of the washtub, try entering the washtub.

Some washing water is inside the washtub. It is fixed in place. The description of the water is "The water is gray and coated with greasy-looking suds." The printed name is "water".

Before taking, drinking or tasting the washing water, say "The grimy underpants of two dozen hygiene-challenged urchins have been steeping in that water all day."

Some dirty underpants are inside the washtub. The description is "The clothes look as gray as the water they're floating in. It's hard to see how they ever actually get clean." The printed name of the underpants is "clothes". Understand "clothes", "laundry" as the underpants.

Instead of doing something other than examining the underpants:
	say "Better leave the clothes alone. They're in that tub for a reason.";

Chapter 2 - Widow Shannon

Section 1 - Description

Widow Shannon is a woman, in the Laundry. The initial appearance is "[if Raid on Maiden House is happening]Widow Shannon is here, looking scared but determined.[otherwise if the location of Widow Shannon is the Laundry]Widow Shannon is bent over the big washtub in the corner, scrubbing out the toddlers['] nappies.[otherwise]Widow Shannon stands nearby.[end if]".

The description is "[if Raid on Maiden House is happening]Although Shannon's face is pale, there is a look of resolve in her features that you have never seen there before. This is her protective side: she will not let anyone — not Fossville, not his armed thugs — harm one of [i]her[r] children.[otherwise if Shannon's Company is happening]Shannon is the youngest of the widows in Maiden House. She is plain-looking, and you've always thought of her as not particularly bright… but she is resourceful and devoted, and your respect for her has grown. She seems energetic and happy to be on this adventure with you.[otherwise]Shannon is the youngest of the widows in Maiden House. She is plain-looking, and none too bright, and, to all appearances, utterly uninterested in ever remarrying, which is perhaps just as well. She devotes herself to the children, particularly the toddlers, and does most of the cleaning and cooking for Maiden House.[end if]"

Instead of kissing Widow Shannon:
	if Raid on Maiden House has not happened, say "Widow Shannon laughs as you give her a hug and a kiss on the cheek. 'Thank you, Jacqueline,' she says. 'I'd return it, but my hands are full of soapsuds!'";
	otherwise say "[one of]Widow Shannon hugs you tightly. 'You're a brave girl, Jacqueline,' she whispers. 'Now let's get going.'[or]'No time for that now, Jacqueline,' Shannon says.[stopping]";

Every turn when in the Laundry and Widow Shannon is nearby and the player is not on the move and Raid on Maiden House has not happened and a random chance of 1 in 4 succeeds:
	[ See Section 10.2.1.2, "Making the secret closet secret" ]
	say "[one of]Widow Shannon picks up a thick wooden stick and jabs at the clothes soaking in the tub, stirring them about[or]Widow Shannon steps back from the tub for a moment, wiping the sweat off her brow[or]Widow Shannon pulls a [one of]shirt[or]shift[or]pair of trousers[or]diaper[or]sock[at random] from the grayish water, wrings it out, and hangs it up on the line behind her[or]Widow Shannon gives you a friendly nod[at random].";

SH5 is a quip. The menu text is "'Oh, nothing.'". The display text is "'Oh, nothing,' you say quickly.

Widow Theresa wouldn't give me the key if I asked, and even if she did, I'd not relish being on her waspish side if I were to let you out.

BO30 is a quip. The menu text is "'I don't know about this.'". The display text is "'I don't know about this, Bobby...' you say. You can't help imagining the sorts of things that might be waiting down there in the dark.[paragraph break]Bobby sighs. 'Come on, Jack, this is an [i]adventure[r].'

You end up pinwheeling your arms desperately, contorting yourself in every direction to avoid a tumble and a thorough soaking. Finally, with arms outstretched and lower lip clamped between your teeth, you pick your way across the remainder of the stream with all the grace of a drunkard on a greased tightrope.[paragraph break]At the edge of the woods, Bobby is nearly doubled over with silent laughter. He claps you on the back. 'You're a good sport, Jack,' he says. 'C'mon, we're nearly there.'";

Before going north from Crossing in the presence of Pieter:
	say "[first time]Now that you've had a bit of practice, you're a bit more confident on the rocks this time. Carefully lifting your skirts (you're still getting used to moving around in a dress), you pick your way over the stream with little difficulty.[paragraph break]Pieter, on the other hand, stumbles halfway across and lurches into the water, soaking his trousers up to the knee. You do your best to stifle your laughter as he sloshes his way to shore, cursing and grumbling something about 'gratitude' and 'youth today.'[only]"

A rectangle of stone about two feet square swings inward. The space behind it is utterly black, and a cold draft of damp-smelling air rises out of it.[paragraph break]'It runs all the way to Lord's Keep,' says Bobby as he brushes off his hands. 'I don't think anyone knows about it. Maybe Lord Toresal did, but now that he's dead it's basically unknown. It's not been used for decades, I'd guess.

One of the mercenaries from Grubber's Market is kneeling with his knee in the small of Bobby's back, binding his wrists together with twine. Standing around the outside of the fountain are several more mercenaries, looking relaxed and smug. Some of them are chuckling to themselves.[paragraph break]A gaunt man wearing red robes walks up to you. His mouth is half-hidden by long, drooping, black moustaches, but underneath them he is smiling like a snake. 'Well now, young...sir? Or is it [']miss[']? So much confusion, all to catch one little mouse. You led us a merry chase this morning, little mouse, but I think you will not scurry away from us again.'[paragraph break]Leaves crunch behind you. You jump for it, but too slow — rough hands haul you back, and a sack of coarse, black cloth is pulled over your head.[paragraph break]'Good night, little mouse.'[paragraph break]Something hard and heavy strikes the back of your head, and the night turns black as pitch.[line break]";

Chapter 7 - Restraining exit

Before going south in the Guardhouse:
	if the table of overheard guardhouse conversation is not empty,

Book 6 - Jail

[ Moved this region declaration up here, because Inform gets cranky if you refer to a region before it's declared. Also, split the "Jail Region" into "Prison Region" (because there's too much namespace conflict with the word 'jail' already) and the "Sewers Region" (see Book 7, below) ]

The Prison Region is a region. The Jailhouse, Jail-Cell, Jail-Cell-2, Jail-Cell-3, and Drain Room are in the Prison.

Part 1 - Jailhouse

Escaping Jail is a scene. Escaping Jail begins when the player is in Jail-Cell. Escaping Jail ends when the location is the sewer.

The Jailhouse is a room. The description of the jailhouse is "The jailhouse is hardly more comfortable than the cells themselves, just a crude, small room of unfinished stone, with a wooden bench and table for the guards. Cells are south, west, and north. A foul smell comes from a tiny alcove to the southwest, and a passageway to the east leads out." Understand "main", "crude", "small", "jail", "gaol", "prison", "unfinished", "stone" as the Jailhouse.

The dead-end description of the Jailhouse is "There's no way out that direction."

After inspecting the Jailhouse in the Drain Room:
	say "The main jailhouse room is northeast of here.";

When escaping jail begins:
	Bobby wakes up in two turns from now;
	repeat with contraband running through things held by the player:
		if the contraband is not the baggy threadbare clothes, remove the contraband from play;

Section 1 - Scenery

The jailhouse-table is a supporter, scenery, in the Jailhouse. Understand "wood", "wooden", "furniture", "rough", "crude", "crudely", "carved", "table" as the jailhouse-table. The description of the jailhouse-table is "The furniture is rough and crudely carved."

A jailhouse-bench is a supporter, scenery, enterable, in the Jailhouse. The printed name of the jailhouse-bench is "bench". Understand "wood", "wooden", "furniture", "rough", "crude", "crudely", "carved", "bench" as the jailhouse-bench. The description of the jailhouse-bench is "The furniture is rough and crudely carved."

Instead of entering the jailhouse-bench:
	say "You don't have time to rest — you need to get out of here!";

Section 2 - The Way Out

[ Somewhere along the way, "the way out" got conflated with the way to the drain room, but they need to be separate directions for this scene to make since. Since we never actually *go* anywhere with Jacobs except to instant death, however, it will serve to make an empty room here with a distant description that can be inspected. --MSG ]

The way-out [it's hyphenated because I'm not confident that it won't conflict with the direction "out" in the code] is a room, east of the Jailhouse. Understand "passage", "passageway", "other", "area", "areas", "of", "prison", "jail", "gaol", "way", "out" as the way-out. The way-out is outside of the Jailhouse. The printed name is "way out".

The distant description of Way-out is "The east passage leads out to other areas of the prison... and hopefully to a way out."

Part 2 - Three cells

Chapter 1 - The holding cell kind

Section 1 - Description

A holding cell is a kind of room. The description of a holding cell is "[cell description]". The printed name of a holding cell is "Holding Cell".

To say cell description:
	let d be north;
	if the location is Jail-Cell-2:
		let d be south;
	if the location is Jail-Cell-3:
		let d be east;
	say "A dank, cramped, foul-smelling cell. A pair of ragged burlap blankets and a few lumps of filthy straw litter the floor. The door is to the [d]. ";

Understand "dank", "small", "cramped", "foul", "foul smelling", "dirty", "filthy", "cell", "jail", "prison", "gaol" as a holding cell.

Section 2 - Restrained Exit

Instead of going east from the Jailhouse: say "There are more guards out there, and you don't know the way. You'll never escape from this jail all by yourself." instead.

Chapter 2 - The holding cell door kind

Section 1 - Description

A cell door is a kind of door. The description of a cell door is "[The item described] is made of stout wood reinforced with bands of iron. A tiny viewing window in the upper half of the door allows guards to look in and prisoners to look out. [The item described] is [if the item described is open]open[otherwise]closed[end if]."

The printed name of a cell door is "cell door". A cell door has a direction called door direction. The door direction of a cell door is usually north. A cell door is usually locked. A cell door is usually scenery. A cell door is always lockable.

Understand "stout", "wood", "wooden", "reinforced", "bands", "band", "metal", "iron", "lock", "door", "cell door" as a cell door.

The matching key of a cell door is usually the piece of wire.

[ Unfortunately we're not allowed to use "Understand the door direction property as describing a cell door" because I7 can't parse direction names in typed commands in this way. Disappointing. ]

Before printing the name of a cell door (called x):
	if the location is the Jailhouse,
		say "[door direction of x] ";

Section 2 - Looking through a cell door (and seeing the other side)

Instead of searching a cell door:
	try looking through the noun instead;
	[as in, "look in north cell"] 

Instead of looking through a cell door:
	if closed,
		say "You peer through the closely spaced bars. ";
	if the location is a holding cell begin;
		say "You can see the jailhouse main room on the other side[if open] of the door[end if].";
	otherwise;
		let the cell in question be the other side of the noun;
		let the body count be the number of people in the cell in question;
		say "You can see a cramped, filthy cell on the other side[if open] of the door[end if]. ";
		[
		And the following code is a good argument for a feature request.
		]
		if the body count > 0 begin;
			let x be the first thing held by cell in question;
			while x is not a person
				repeatedly let x be the next thing held after x;
			repeat with i running from 1 to body count begin;
				if i is 1 begin;
					say "[A x]";
				otherwise if the next thing held after x is nothing;
					say "[if i is not 2],[end if] and [a x]";
				otherwise;
					say ", [a x]";
				end if;
				let x be the next thing held after x;
				if x is not nothing begin;
					while x is not a person
						repeatedly let x be the next thing held after x;
				end if;
			end repeat;
			if the body count is 1 begin;
				say "[is or are for the first thing held by the cell in question] ";
			otherwise;
				say " are ";
			end if;
			say "inside. " ;
		end if;
		say "[paragraph break]";
	end if;

Section 3 - The viewing window kind

A viewing window is a kind of container. The description of a viewing window is "The viewing window is just a tiny square, no more than two handspans to a side, fitted with tough, closely spaced iron bars." The printed name of a viewing window is "viewing window". Understand "tiny", "square", "small", "bar", "bars", "barred", "tough", "iron", "close", "closely spaced" as a viewing window.

After printing the name of a viewing window (called win):
	if the location is the Jailhouse,
		say " in the [door direction of holder of win] door";

Instead of looking through a viewing window (called win):
	try looking through the holder of win;

Section 4 - Reaching through windows

[ I don't actually want to implement this as an action... it doesn't generalize well, it would create too many special cases, and it adds nothing to gameplay. However, it is a reasonable thing for someone to type when trying to get out of jail, so we'll add some error messages to handle it.]

Understand "reach" as a mistake ("[reach message]").
Understand "reach [something]" as a mistake ("[reach message]").
Understand "reach in/through/into/between/for [something]" as a mistake ("[reach message]").
Understand "reach arm/hand in/through/into/between [something]" as a mistake ("[reach message]").
Understand "reach in/through/into/between [viewing window]" as a mistake ("[lockpicking message]").
Understand "reach arm/hand in/through/into/between [viewing window]" as a mistake ("[lockpicking message]").
Understand "put arm/hand in/through/into/between [viewing window]" as a mistake ("[lockpicking message]").

To say reach message:
	say "You don't need to 'reach' anything in this game. If you want to get something, just type GET (whatever). ";

To say lockpicking message:
	say "If you want to try to unlock the door, just type UNLOCK DOOR. ";

Chapter 3 - Construction of the Jail Cells

Jail-Cell-3 overlooks the Jailhouse.

Instead of inspecting a holding cell (called target):
	let dir be the best route from location to target, using even locked doors;
	try facing dir.

Instead of facing south in the Jailhouse, try searching cell-door-1.
Instead of facing north in the Jailhouse, try searching cell-door-2.
Instead of facing west in the Jailhouse, try searching cell-door-3.

Section 2 - Three tricky doors

A locked cell door called a cell-door-1 is south of the jailhouse and north of Jail-Cell. The door direction is south. A viewing window called a Viewing Window 1 is part of cell-door-1. Understand "south" as cell-door-1 when the location is the Jailhouse. Understand "south" as Viewing Window 1 when the location is the Jailhouse.

Instead of facing north in Jail-Cell, try searching cell-door-1.

A locked cell door called a cell-door-2 is north of the jailhouse and south of Jail-Cell-2. The door direction is north. Understand "north" as cell-door-2 when the location is the Jailhouse. A viewing window called a Viewing Window 2 is part of cell-door-2. Understand "north" as Viewing Window 2 when the location is the Jailhouse.

Instead of facing south in Jail-Cell-2, try searching cell-door-2.

A locked cell door called a cell-door-3 is west of the jailhouse and east of Jail-Cell-3. The door direction is west. Understand "west" as cell-door-3 when the location is the Jailhouse. A viewing window called a Viewing Window 3 is part of cell-door-3. Understand "west" as Viewing Window 3 when the location is the Jailhouse.

Instead of facing east in Jail-Cell-3, try searching cell-door-3.

Before going through a cell door from the Jailhouse, say "[one of]It's such a huge relief just to be [i]out[r] of a jail cell; you definitely have no desire to get back into one.[or]No, you'd rather stay out of jail cells for a while.[or]You're not going back in there.[stopping]" instead;

Section 3 - Scoping

After deciding the scope of the player while in the Jailhouse:
	if the bald headed man is in Jail-Cell-2 begin;

Chapter 2 - Event on entering

Before looking in Jail-Cell for the first time:
	repeat with x running through things carried by the player begin;
		[ remove x from play; ] [TESTME - is the 'contraband' loop above good?]
	end repeat;
	say "Slowly the world comes back to you. You feel something cold and hard against your cheek; something gritty and scratchy under your hand. You hear footsteps on stone, muttering voices that fade in and out. Someone laughs, a raw, cruel sound. A loud squeak, and an echoing, metallic crash. The footsteps fade away.[paragraph break]You open your eyes. It's still dark.[paragraph break]No, it's just [i]dim[r]. Dim light trickles in from somewhere above you.[paragraph break]You sit up, and a tender spot on the back of your head throbs. Red and purple splotches bloom in front of your eyes, then fade away. After a moment or two, your head clears, and you can see where you are.";

Chapter 3 - Bobby's Voice

Bobby's Voice is a scene. Bobby's Voice begins when Bobby is in the Jailhouse. Bobby's Voice ends when Bobby is off-stage.

After deciding the scope of the player when talking to during Bobby's Voice:

Section 1 - Introduction

[ I was going to use a new object for this bit, but... well, why not use the real, authentic Bobby? ]

At the time when Bobby wakes up:
	move Bobby to the Jailhouse; [Just for convenience. Really he ought to be in his cell, but never mind: he won't be described anywhere because we don't mention occupants of the Jailhouse when looking through the viewing window.]
	carry out the assembling activity;
	add Bobby to the roster of available characters, if absent;
	carry out the character-listing activity;
	start conversation with Bobby on BO16, even if not present;

Section 2 - Further conversation with Bobby - In the Jailhouse

BO16 is a quip. The display text is "Suddenly you hear a voice whisper your name. [i]'Jack...'[r][paragraph break]At first you think it's the creepy guy in the corner, but he hasn't moved.

BO17 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Bobby? Is that you?'". The display text is "You rush up and press your face against the viewing window, but you can't see anything out there except an empty room. 'Bobby?' you call, trying to keep the fear out of your voice. 'Bobby, is that you? I'm locked in here, Bobby, help me!'". The following quip is BO18.

BO18 is a quip. The display text is "The voice chuckles, then coughs weakly. 'I'm in the cell next to yours, Jack. I'm locked in, too. Sorry.'[paragraph break]Your heart sinks a little at that, but at least being trapped in a cell with Bobby nearby is a [i]little[r] bit better than being trapped in a cell with no one around to help you at all... right?[paragraph break]'Jack, listen,' Bobby says. His voice is ragged and hoarse; you're worried that the mercenaries might have hurt him badly. 'I'm going to get us out of this mess, don't worry. But in case I'm not able to meet up with you after, you need to listen carefully.'"

BO19 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'What do you mean?'". The display text is "'Not able to meet up with me?' you whisper, dismayed. 'What do you mean? What-' but Bobby cuts you off.". The following quip is BO20.

'Bobby, I don't understand-'[paragraph break]'He has secrets,' Bobby goes on, 'that you need to know. Secrets about your [i]father[r].'[paragraph break]You pause, stunned.[paragraph break]'Look for a letter-' says Bobby, but he is cut off by a door slamming open elsewhere in the room. Guards move past your cell door; one of them slams a wooden cudgel against the bars right in front of your face, and you stagger back."

BO21 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Bobby, what's happening?'". The display text is "'Bobby?' you cry, '[i]Bobby?[no line break][r] What's happening? What letter?'". The following quip is BO22.

BO22 is a quip. The display text is "You hear a metallic rattling, the squeak of hinges. Then several meaty [i]thuds[r], mixed with grunts and cries of pain. The guards reappear, this time dragging Bobby with them. He looks up as he passes the viewing window, and you get a brief glimpse of his face — bruised, bloody, but still smiling. You'd swear he was trying to wink at you, except that his eye is swollen shut.[paragraph break]'Fossville, Jack!' he yells as they bundle him off. 'The rooftops! [i]Look for the letter![no line break][r]'[paragraph break]Somewhere a door slams one final time... and then everything is silent."

The response of BO16 is { BO17 }.

The response of BO18 is { BO19 }.

The response of BO20 is { BO21 }.

Section 3 - Structure of conversation

		[ conversation is genuinely over ]
		now the current conversationalist is the player;

It's more like he's just muttering to himself.[paragraph break]He bends over and digs something out of the side of his boot, then stands up and thrusts his hand through the viewing window.

The following quip is JA13.

JA13 is a quip. The display text is "'That's the spirit, runt!' Jacobs says.

JA14 is a quip. The menu text is "'Yes.'". The display text is "You manage a nod. It's [i]sort of[r] true... Bobby showed you a few tricks once, and you've practiced on an old padlock.

After a moment he nods, opens the door, and then shoves you through it into the next room.[paragraph break]Bright lantern-light blinds you, and when your eyes clear you see a dozen men of the Lord's Guard standing in a semicircle around you... and in the middle, the man in the red robes.[paragraph break]'Little mouse...' murmurs the man in the red robes, '...always finding some new hole to crawl through.'[paragraph break]Behind you, Jacobs puts his heavy hand on your shoulder and grips it tight. 'Like I said, runt,' he laughs, 'Fossville has taken a special interest in you. And aiding the Baron in his interests can be very profitable.'[paragraph break]The red-robed man and the guards close in on you. This time, you do not escape."

JA23 is a quip. The display text is "Jacobs snorts. 'You must be dim, you pathetic boozer.' To you he says, 'We don't have time for him.

Section 4 - Structure of Jacobs's Conversation

Rule for initiating conversation with the prisoner:
	change the chosen opening gambit to JA1;

At the time when Jacobs starts talking:
	if JA2 is unfired, start conversation with the prisoner on JA2;

[And here's a rule in case the player starts talking to Jacobs before he starts talking:]

Instead of talking to the prisoner when BO22 is fired and JA2 is unfired:
	start conversation with the prisoner on JA2;

After firing JA2:
	now the prisoner is proper-named;
	update the character list;

After firing JA7:
	Jacobs asks our help in one turn from now;

Instead of talking to the prisoner when JA7 is fired and JA8 is unfired:
	say "Jacobs ignores you completely.";

	start conversation with the prisoner on JA8;

After firing JA8:
	now the prisoner carries the piece of wire;

Instead of talking to the prisoner when JA8 is fired and JA14 is unfired and JA15 is unfired:
	say "Jacob grunts. 'Take the lockpick, runt. Ain't got all day.'";

At the time when Jacobs seemingly gives up on us:
	if JA13 is unfired begin;
		carry out the firing activity with JA11;
		now the current conversation is {  };
		carry out the terminating conversation with activity with the prisoner;
	end if;

After firing JA11:
	move the piece of wire to the Jail-Cell.

Instead of talking to the prisoner when JA11 is fired and JA13 is unfired:
	say "Jacobs pointedly ignores you.";

After firing JA12:
	now the player carries the piece of wire.

After taking the piece of wire when in the Jail-Cell for the first time:
	start conversation with the prisoner on JA13;

After firing JA13:
	now the player is caught;

Instead of talking to the prisoner when the door is locked and (JA14 is fired or JA15 is fired):
	say "Jacobs pointedly ignores you.";

Every turn when in the Jailhouse and Jacobs is nearby and JA16 is unfired: 
	start conversation with the prisoner on JA16;

After firing JA16:
	Jacobs offers his support in two turns from now;

At the time when Jacobs offers his support:
	if JA19 is unfired and the prisoner is on-stage,
		start conversation with the prisoner on JA19;

After firing JA19:

After firing JA22:
	end the game in death;

Section 5 - Scripted Actions

Jacobs's lockpicking attempt is a scene. Jacobs's lockpicking attempt begins when JA7 is fired. Jacobs's lockpicking attempt ends when the table of Jacobs's frustrated mutterings is empty.

Instead of unlocking cell-door-1 with the piece of wire when JA14 is unfired and JA15 is unfired and the location is the Jail-Cell:
	say "You can't reach the door from here."; 

After unlocking cell-door-1 with the wire when the player is caught during Picking a Lock:
	now the piece of wire is in the Jailhouse;
	now the player is free;
	now cell-door-1 is open;
	Jacobs leaves his cell in one turn from now;
	say "You slip your arm through the bars and reach down for the lock. It's a stretch — Jacobs has to lift you higher and press your shoulder painfully against the bars — but soon you feel the metal of the lockplate, and your fingers find the tiny, sharp-edged hole in the middle.[paragraph break]You jam the end of the lockpick in and start wiggling it around. Almost immediately, you realize that this is not going to work. The angle is too awkward, and you can't see what you're doing, and you can't feel the tumblers the way Bobby showed you when you practiced on the front door of Maiden House...[paragraph break]Then you feel the wire bump against something inside the lock. You manage to lever the end of the wire under something and push... you feel it start to give... you push a little harder, and it starts to pivot... you push harder, and it starts to slip off the end of your pick...[paragraph break]And then there is a [i]snap[r], and the pick jumps out of your fingers and tumbles to the ground outside the cell door.[paragraph break]Jacobs puts you down. He puts his hand on the door... and pushes it open.[paragraph break]'Well,' he says, looking you over with a sly expression, 'you are a valuable runt, after all.'"

At the time when Jacobs leaves his cell:
	now cell-door-1 is open;
	try the prisoner going north.

Part 1 - The Sewer room

Chapter 1 - Description


The Sewer is a room. The description is "The tunnels down here are made of ancient, unmortared brick, slimy with centuries of filth and mold. Dim light trickles down through narrow vents in the ceiling. Side tunnels split off in numerous directions, twisting away into darkness."

Understand "sewers", "tunnel", "tunnels", "side", "dark", "darkness" as the Sewer.

Instead of facing a planar direction in the Sewers Region, say "These tunnels seem to go in every direction."

Instead of smelling the location while in the Sewers Region:
	say "The smell down here is simply unbelievable. You have to breathe through your mouth just to keep from passing out."

Section 1 - Contents

The sewer water is a backdrop, in the Sewers Region. The description is "The water is sluggish and cold, knee-deep in most places. [i]Things[r] float past you in the ooze — garbage, dead rats, and worse. You try to avoid the worst of it, but it's already soaked through your shoes. You feel like you'll never be clean of it." Understand "sluggish", "cold", "deep", "knee deep", "dead", "sewage", "ooze", "garbage", "rat", "rats" as the sewer water.

Instead of searching, drinking, smelling or tasting the sewer water, say "The thought makes you gag."

A glyph has a symbol color called the color.
A glyph has a sewer-symbol called the symbol.

Understand the color property as describing a glyph.
Understand the symbol property as describing a glyph.

The south glyph is a glyph in the Sewer. The way of the south glyph is south.
The west glyph is a glyph in the Sewer. The way of the west glyph is west.

[A line of grammar for "following" the glyphs, since this is explicitly suggested by Olmer.]

Understand "follow [glyph]" as following.

Instead of following a glyph: try going the way of the noun.

Section 3 - Collective Glyphs

Some painted symbols are in the Sewer. "Painted on the walls are a number of odd symbols." The description is "The symbols are a number of crude shapes, no bigger than your hand. Each one is painted on the wall next to one of the side tunnels, as if to mark the way. [Glyph report]". Understand "paint", "shapes", "glyphs" as the painted symbols.

Listing the names of glyphs is an activity.

To say glyph report:
	carry out the listing the names of glyphs activity;

Rule for listing the names of glyphs:
	say "You can make out [a list of glyphs]. ";

Rule for printing the name of a glyph (called target):
	say "[color of target] [symbol of target]";

After printing the name of a glyph (called target) while listing the names of glyphs:
	 say " next to the [way of the target] tunnel";

Chapter 2 - Event on entering

The magic color is a symbol color that varies.

To decide which glyph is the magic glyph:
	let the glyph list be {north glyph, east glyph, south glyph, west glyph};
	repeat with current glyph running through the glyph list begin;
		if the color of the current glyph is the magic color begin;
			decide on the current glyph;
		end if;
	end repeat;
	[all four colors are assigned to glyphs, so the loop won't reach this point.]

After looking in the Sewer for the first time:
	Change the magic color to a random symbol color;
	update glyphs;
	say "Olmer drops down into the muck next to you, followed by Darrens. 
'Now then, miss, cast your eye at these glyphs here,' whispers Olmer. His voice echoes off into the blackness as he brushes the rough stone with his fingertips. 'These are marked down by such poor blokes as have to take refuge down here on a more regular basis. They tells you where the tunnels lead, if you but know their language.' Darrens nods in solemn agreement.[paragraph break]'To get back to your neighborhood, you'll want to follow the [magic color], see?' Olmer points off down [the way of the magic glyph] tunnel. 'Darrens and I, we must be off elsewhere, so we'll take our leave of you now. But follow the [magic color] and you can't go wrong.'[paragraph break]'It was very kind of you to set us free, young lady.' He shakes your hand. (His hands are slimy with filth, but then so are yours.) 'We've only our meagre gratitude with which to repay you, but we won't forget your generosity.' Darrens nods vigorously and shakes as well.[paragraph break]And then the two of them slosh off, leaving you alone.";

Chapter 3 - Sewer Puzzle

Section 1 - Sewer puzzle implementation

The sewer move count is a number that varies. The sewer move count is 0.
The sewer safety count is a number that varies. The sewer safety count is 0.

To update glyphs:
	[ We need to use all four colors, and assign each one a unique symbol. The recent addition of lists to I7 makes this exceptionally easy - if you're used to a list processing language like Haskell or LISP. ]
	let the symbol list be { square, diamond, circle, triangle, crescent, star, cross, arrow };
	let the color list be { red, blue, green, yellow };
	let the glyph list be { the north glyph, the south glyph, the east glyph, the west glyph };

Understand "sewer", "sewers", "tunnel", "tunnels", "side", "dark", "darkness" as the Access Tunnel.

Instead of facing up in the Access Tunnel, try examining the hatch.

[We don't need glyphs in the Access Tunnel, and in fact it's confusing to the player, since it might imply that they should continue following the 'magic' glyph. So we're commenting out the transport glyphs routine, here and in the before going rule above.]

	now every glyph is in the Access Tunnel;
	now the painted symbols are in the Access Tunnel; ]

Section 3 - Losing the sewer puzzle

To run the sewer death ending:
	say "Suddenly you find yourself in a tunnel where there are no symbols painted anywhere. You try to retrace your steps, but you must have taken a wrong turn somewhere, because now you can't find any symbols anywhere. All of the tunnels look alike; you are completely turned around and don't even know which direction you are stumbling in.[paragraph break]The next tunnel you take leads you to an area with no vents — it is pitch black. You slip as you turn around and fall into the water. Something slick and wriggly brushes past your face, and you thrash to your feet.[paragraph break]You can't see any light, anywhere. You don't know what direction you just came from. Cold, smelly water numbs your feet. Despair and paralyzing panic close in on you as you realize that you have no means of finding your way through this labyrinth.[paragraph break]You are stuck down here, blind in the stinking blackness, forever.";
	end the game in death;

My wife was ever a dutiful companion, but never truly happy. I do not blame her. For my part, I did my best to ensure that she lived a lifestyle fitting for a Duchess, and that she wanted for nothing save my love.[paragraph break]Were this the full extent of my shame, I would have no need to write to you, for a loveless marriage is hardly a rare thing in our kingdom. However, it is to confess yet a further disgrace that I must pen this letter. I was not merely cool in my affections, but an unfaithful husband as well. I took a mistress, a woman on whom I bestowed all the tenderness I was unable to give my wife. And with this mistress, I had a child.[paragraph break]I kept the child's existence a secret, as much to spare my wife the ignominy as to avoid the political complications that would otherwise have ensued. From my private finances I established an orphanage here in the city, and paid a tutor from the Royal College to pose as one of the headmistresses, to raise and educate the child properly. In secret I have sponsored this child for ten years.[paragraph break]I feel it is past time for this secrecy to end. I have grown ill with a mysterious sickness these past months, and I fear that my life will soon come to a close. My wife was never able to provide me with a lawful heir, and yet I would not see my family name extinguished merely because I had not the courage to face up to my failings as a husband.[paragraph break]Therefore it is my wish that the crown recognize this child, who bears no fault for the circumstances of her birth, as my sole and lawful beneficiary, to inherit my title and estate in full upon my death, or upon her sixteenth birthday should I die before she reaches the age of majority. I hereby, by my will and by royal law, and in full possession of my faculties, declare my heir:[paragraph break]
[fixed letter spacing]          [variable letter spacing][i]Jacqueline Toresal[paragraph break]Signed and witnessed therewith,[paragraph break]Lord William, Duke of Toresal[r][paragraph break]"

After examining the letter for the first time:
	say "Your hand is trembling as you refold the letter. You tell yourself that it's a coincidence, just someone who happens to have the same first name as you — but in your heart you know it must be true.[paragraph break]And yet... it poses so many more questions than it answers. The letter is addressed to the queen, and dated three years ago, just a few months before the Duke's death. Why was it never posted? And what is it doing in Baron Fossville's library?[paragraph break]A noise from the bedroom startles you out of your puzzling. Now that you have what you came for, you need to get out of here — fast.";

Chapter 2 - Caught by the butler

You try to duck around the person and run, but he grabs your arm and pulls you back. 'Little thief!' a voice hisses, 'What are you doing here? What do you have?'[paragraph break]He turns you around to face him. He's an older man, wearing a servant's uniform — Fossville's butler.";

	say "The butler silences you with a stern look.";

Instead of showing the letter to the Butler for the first time:

Instead of showing the letter to the Butler:

text
"The butler drags you into the stairwell, then stops, his thin, bald head cocked, listening. From downstairs you hear more voices.[paragraph break]'...difficult [i]is[r] it to keep one half-witted street urchin locked in a cage for a single night?' That's the Baron again, you realize. 'Because it is evidently far more difficult than I imagined. Perhaps I am not paying you enough for your heroic efforts so far?'[paragraph break]You hear a low, mumbled response.[paragraph break]'No, I daresay you don't,' snaps the Baron, his voice acid with sarcasm. 'I cannot express how galling it is that I still require your services; were it otherwise, I would sooner turn you all over to the Lord's Guards and let them deal with you like the useless curs you are.'[paragraph break]The butler glances at you, one bushy eyebrow raised. You're beginning to suspect that Baron Fossville is not particularly well liked by his servants.[conditional paragraph break]"
[row marker]
"'Gather your men at Lord's Market,' says Fossville. 'We'll deal with the spy first. Once that business is finished, we pay a visit to the Maidens. Though I suppose I should warn you — you may encounter several unarmed, elderly women there. Let us hope they pose no greater challenge to your mercenaries than a fourteen-year-old girl.'[paragraph break]The second voice mumbles another response.[paragraph break]'See that you do. I will be there shortly.'[paragraph break]You hear footsteps, and then a heavy door slamming.[paragraph break]The butler holds his hand up, palm out. [i]Wait.[r][conditional paragraph break]"
[row marker]
"Several agonizing minutes later, you hear the door slam a second time. The butler waits a few minutes more, then drags you downstairs. He takes you through the kitchens to a side door, and shoves you unceremoniously out onto the street.[paragraph break]'Go now, and don't come back,' he says. 'Next time, it won't be me that catches you. And if it is me, it'll go that much worse for you. A bit of advice, girl,' he adds, just before turning away. 'Keep yourself out of the Baron's way. He's not one to let a trifling of blood get in between him and his ambitions.'[paragraph break]He slams the door.[conditional paragraph break]"

He slashes wildly at Bobby, forcing him back through sheer strength of blows.[otherwise]Now that you're up close, the cracks in Fossville's façade show themselves clearly. His thick, black hair is disheveled. His face is haggard. He's tried to hide the lines and the dark circles under his eyes with extra make-up, but it just makes him look more ghoulish[first time]. With some satisfaction, you realize that you must have been really running the Baron ragged the last couple of days. No wonder he hasn't made an appearance at his own party[only].[end if]"

The initial appearance of Baron Fossville is "Baron Fossville stands between you and the fireplace, casting his shadow across the entire room."

More often than not, this duty is a heavy burden. Though I may wish to be lenient, consideration for the sanctity of the law and the safety of the Queen's subjects must always outweigh my softer instincts. Today, this burden weighs particularly upon me, for today I must administer the most stringent punishment allowed by the law.'[paragraph break]Soldiers prod a second man up onto the platform. The black bag covers his face, but you recognize him by the clothes he's wearing — it's Bobby!"

B_H2 is a scripted event. The display text is "'This man before you stands accused of plotting high treason against the city of Toresal,' shouts the Baron.

'By the power invested in me and in accordance with the Queen's Law... I hereby sentence this man to hang by the neck until dead.'[paragraph break]The Baron turns to one of his soldiers at the platform's base and nods his head.[paragraph break]Later, you cannot remember whether you really heard the [i]clunk[r] of the trapdoor falling open, the rope snapping taut, or whether you only imagined it. You remember screaming, clawing at the spectators in front of you, and being pushed back by rough, angry hands. You stumbled and fell onto the cobblestones. You never saw his body drop.[paragraph break]Everything goes black."

Her eyes are red and raw, though, like she's been crying. For a moment, you feel strange, disconnected. You wonder what's wrong.[paragraph break]And then it comes back to you. It's Bobby. Bobby is dead.[paragraph break]";
	start conversation with Widow Fiona on FI21;

Instead of going from the Dormitory during Bedside Consolation:
	say "You try to leave, but you're still disoriented, light-headed, and the floor seems to tilt beneath your feet[first time]. 'Wait,' Fiona says gently, putting her hand on your shoulder and guiding you back to the bed. 'Just wait. Rest. You're still in shock.'[subsequently].[only]";

It's all right.'"

The following quip is FI25.

FI25 is a quip. The display text is "...and then something breaks inside, and it all comes gushing out. Fiona's arms are around you, and your tears are soaking into her blouse as the sobs rack their way up from the deepest part of your gut, and she is whispering, 'Oh child... oh my dear child...'[paragraph break]'[i]Buh-buh-Bobby...[no line break][r]' you wail, feeling stupid and weak and scared and guilty and oh, so alone. How did this happen? You were talking to him just yesterday. You snuck out for a lark, and now he's... he's...[paragraph break]'Hush,' Fiona says softly, stroking your hair. 'I know, child. I know.'[paragraph break][i]I never told him my name![r] you want to scream. You never told him your real name, and you never told him how you felt about him, and now he's dead, and he never really knew you at all.[paragraph break]But then you remember the letter, and all the things Bobby told you in the Jail... what if he [i]did[r] know you? What if he knew you even better than you knew yourself?"

FI26 is a quip. The display text is "Widow Fiona takes a deep breath, then turns to you and smiles weakly. 'Now, then. We don't have much time before the Baron's men come back, and I'm sure you have questions.'"

FI27 is a quip. The menu text is "'You're the tutor, aren't you?'". The display text is "Suddenly a piece of the mystery clicks into place. 'You're the tutor, aren't you?' you ask. It isn't really a question. 'The old Duke... my father... he hired you to keep an eye on me, didn't he.'[paragraph break]Fiona nods. 'Yes, that's right. The Duke had this orphanage built and placed you in it, and he brought me down from Aubrimere to look after you and see to your education. That was almost fourteen years ago, and I've been watching over you ever since.'"

FI28 is a quip. The menu text is "'Tell me about my father.'". The display text is "'Then it's true,' you say, half to yourself. 'The Duke of Toresal really was my father. And you knew him!'[paragraph break]Fiona nods again. 'I'm sorry I could not tell you sooner, Jacqueline,' she says.[paragraph break]'Tell me about him,' you say.[paragraph break]She sighs. 'To tell you everything you want to know would take too long, and the Baron's men will be back soon.

[row marker]
"'Where is who, sir?' That must be Fiona.[paragraph break]'Don't play games with me, woman,' snaps the first voice. 'I've had my fill of it. The old Duke isn't here to protect you anymore, and if one of my men were to be careless and injure someone, it would rest but lightly on the Baron's conscience. Now, we know she came here after the hanging.

That's Shannon's voice.[paragraph break]'What is it?' yells the mercenary captain. 'Where did the girl go?'[paragraph break]'She... she got away from me, Miss Fiona,' wails Shannon. 'I was trying to get her into the hiding place, just like you said, but she slipped past me and wriggled out the privy window. You know how fast she can get through that window, Miss Fiona. She could be anywhere in the city by now. I'm so sorry, Miss Fiona, so sorry.'[paragraph break]You can't help but grin. You've always thought of Shannon as being a trifle dim-witted, and now you'll have to revise your opinion.[conditional paragraph break]"

"The mercenary captain utters a curse so foul that you actually wince. 'Don't just stand there, you bleeding dims,' he yells, 'get out there and find her! You two, keep an eye on the alley in case she comes back. Go! Go! Find her or I'll have your hides!' The footsteps run back up the hall, growing fainter this time, then vanishing altogether as they cross the threshold and exit Maiden House.[paragraph break]You let out a long, shaky breath.[conditional paragraph break]"

The Bathroom is south of the Red Gate Master Bedroom. "The walls of this small room are cold, bare marble. The only exit is to the north." The distant description of the Bathroom is "A bathroom lies to the south."

Understand "small", "cold", "bare", "marble", "wall", "walls", "doorway" as the Red Gate Master Bedroom.

Chapter 2 - Bathtub

The bathtub is scenery in the bathroom. The description is "The basin is carved from a single block of granite, polished smooth as glass. It looks almost big enough to swim in." The printed name is "basin". Understand "bath", "tub", "basin", "granite", "stone", "big", "block", "block of", "carved", "polished", "smooth", "lip", "huge" as the bathtub.

Chapter 3 - Faucets

Some faucets are fixed in place, in the bathroom. "A pair of strange-looking devices protrudes from the south wall, hanging over the lip of a huge stone basin." Understand "strange", "strange looking", "device", "devices", "wheel", "wheels", "faucet", "brass", "ivory", "fitting", "fittings", "spout", "pair", "plumbing", "pipe", "pipes", "protruding", "spoke", "spokes", "spoked", "curved", "hand sized", "running water", "water", "curving", "gold", "golden", "cold", "hot" as the faucets. Understand "pair of" as the faucets.

Instead of examining the faucets for the first time, say "The device is made of brass and ivory and protrudes from carved fittings in the wall, at about waist height. It consists of a curved spout flanked by two hand-sized, spoked wheels...[paragraph break]Suddenly you figure it out — these are faucets! Running-water pipes, or 'plumbing' as some call them, are a very recent invention, incredibly rare in Toresal. You've never actually seen faucets up close before.[paragraph break]'Oh, a bath with water-pipes! What a luxury,' exclaims Shannon. 'I've never had a bath that I didn't have to fill myself from a kettle. Back and forth and back and forth — it's either that or take it cold. Kind of takes the relaxation out of it, if you ask me,' she sighs ruefully. 'The Lord Duke was a man of taste and distinction on top of everything else. True nobility, he was.'[paragraph break]And it occurs to you, as you look at your distorted reflection in the golden, curving pipes, you've never had a bath with running water, either. In fact, you can't remember the last time you had [i]any[r] sort of bath, not even the quick spit-baths in a wooden tub full of tepid, cloudy water that are the norm in Maiden House. You've spent your life coated with the grime of the streets more often than not, reeking of sweat and alleyways, hardly noticing it because the smell is around you constantly, and around everyone you know.[paragraph break]But, you realize for the first time, [i]that's not really who you are[r]. You are the Duke's daughter, a child of nobility. By all rights, you should have been sleeping on feather mattresses, smelling of rosewater. This luxury is your heritage… and you've never known a single day of it in your life."

The description of the faucets is "The faucets are made of brass and ivory and protrude from carved fittings in the wall, at about waist height. The curved spout is flanked by two wheels: one for cold water, the other (though you can scarcely imagine it) for hot."

Instead of switching on the faucets, try turning the faucets instead.
Instead of turning the faucets:
	say "A groaning sound reverberates behind the walls, and then a spout of clean, clear water gushes out of the spout and splashes into the tub."

Chapter 4 - Taking a bath

Bathing is an action applying to nothing.
Understand "bathe" as bathing.
Understand "bathe self" as bathing.
Understand "take bath" as bathing.
Understand "take a bath" as bathing.
Understand "have bath" as bathing.
Understand "have a bath" as bathing.

Carry out bathing:
	try washing the player instead;

Instead of washing the player in the presence of the bathtub:
	try entering the bathtub.

Instead of entering the bathtub for the first time:
	repeat with garment running through wearable things had by the player begin;
		remove the garment from play;
	end repeat;
	move the old clothes to the location;
	now the player is clean;
	now the player carries the daydress;
	say "You plug the drain and begin filling the enormous tub with water.[paragraph break]Shannon nods with approval but says nothing; somehow she seems to know what you were thinking. By the time you've gotten out of your sodden clothes and into the water, she's managed to scare up a cake of soap from somewhere. She smiles as she hands it to you.[paragraph break]The water is scalding hot and exquisite. You rub the soap into your reddening skin, feeling everything wash clean away. Not just the dirt and the sweat, but [i]everything[r]: the fear and confusion of being hunted for two days straight; the moldy tunnel under Lord's Keep; the prison; the sewers. Even your grief and guilt over Bobby's death — it doesn't go away completely, not all of it, but it's not so heavy any more, not so sharp.[paragraph break]You dry off with a sheet pulled from the furniture. As you reach for your old clothes, Shannon stops you and holds out a dress.[paragraph break]'Where in the world—?' you ask.[paragraph break]'The Duke's wife was a little lady, just about your size, really,' Shannon says. 'Not beautiful, but handsome in her way. And good taste in clothes.' She puts the dress into your hands.";

Instead of entering the bathtub [subsequent times]:
	say "Once is enough for today."

Chapter 5 - Old clothes for new

Your old clothes are a thing. The description is "Your old clothes are threadbare and crusted with filth." Instead of taking or wearing the old clothes, say "Now that you're finally clean, you don't think you could bear to put those filthy rags on again." Understand "filthy", "rags", "threadbare", "filth", "crusty", "crusted", "encrusted" as the old clothes.

The daydress is a wearable thing. The description is "It's nothing fancy — a simple skirt and blouse of finespun linen, with an embroidered bodice. The sort of day dress you might see a somewhat well-to-do lady wearing to the market. It is finer than anything you've ever worn in your life." The printed name is "dress". Understand "simple", "finespun", "embroidered", "embroidery", "fine", "skirt", "blouse", "linen", "bodice", "day dress" as the daydress. Understand "dress" as the daydress when the location does not enclose the clothes.

Does the player mean buying the daydress:
	it is very unlikely;

After wearing the daydress:
	say "You slip the dress over your head, and Shannon helps you with the laces. The linen feels soft and light on your skin. She was right about the size, too; it's a just a little bit big around your chest; otherwise it fits fine[first time][paragraph break]Finally, you look in the mirror. A complete stranger looks back at you: fair of skin, with dark eyes and high cheekbones. She wears fine clothes, and the tangles have been brushed out of her hair. She looks, you realize, quite pretty.[paragraph break][i]This isn't Jack anymore,[r] you think to yourself. [i]This is Jacqueline[r][only].";

Before taking off the daydress:
	say "This isn't really the proper time or place to get undressed." instead;

Section 2 - Concerning nakedness

Definition: a person is naked:
	if the number of things worn by the person is 0, yes;
	otherwise no.

Before going from the bathroom when the player is naked:
	say "You can't leave here naked!" instead.

Book 12 - Ball

Part 1 - Events at Dame Sandlers

	say "Chapter 9 - Preparations";
	select the main channel;
	update the character list;
	start conversation with Dame Sandler on DS31;

After talking to Dame Sandler when DS49 is fired:
	say "Dame Sandler interrupts you with an upheld finger. 'There's no time, child. You must hurry.'"

Instead of giving the secret letter to Dame Sandler:
	try showing the secret letter to Dame Sandler instead;

Instead of showing the secret letter to Dame Sandler:
	say "That is proof of your heritage, Jacqueline,' Dame Sandler says. 'Guard it well; it is the most valuable thing you possess.'"

Before going from the jewelers shop when DS31 is fired and DS49 is unfired:
	say "Dame Sandler takes your elbow, gently but firmly. [if DS44 is unfired]'Please don't go yet, dear; what I have to tell you is dreadfully important.'[otherwise]'Wait, Jacqueline. There are a few things yet you should know.'" instead;

Before going from the jewelers shop when DS31 is fired and DS49 is fired and the player has no dress jewelry:

Chapter 2 - Further Conversation

DS31 is a quip. The display text is "Dame Sandler looks you over and smiles. She does not seem at all surprised by your change in dress.[paragraph break]'Lady Jacqueline,' she says, inclining her head, 'how nice to see you finally looking yourself, after all these years. Come, child, let me get a look at you.' She takes your chin gently between finger and thumb and tilts your face back and forth. 'Hmm. You've simply destroyed your hair, of course, but there's nothing to be done now. It will grow out eventually.'"

DS32 is a quip. The menu text is "'You knew I was a girl all along?'". The display text is "Dame Sandler laughs, not unkindly. 'Oh, child, did you really think I hadn't guessed? It's not that great a secret, you know; more people have had their eye on you than you realize. We've all been waiting for the Duke's daughter to finally make herself known, and now here you are.'"

DS33 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Who's had their eye on me?'". The display text is "'What do you mean, [']had their eye on me[']?' you say, all your old suspicions returning. 'Who else knew? Who's been watching me?'"
The following quip is DS38.

DS34 is a quip. The menu text is "'Widow Fiona sent me.'". The display text is "'Widow Fiona sent me,' you say. 'She said that you could help me.'[paragraph break]Dame Sandler nods. 'I know, child. I've been expecting her to send you to me any day now. I'm sorry I couldn't help you before, but we — Fiona and I — dared not risk Baron Fossville discovering that I knew who you were. I was only to step in as a last resort, when the Baron had tracked you down and chased you from every other hiding place.'"

DS35 is a quip. The menu text is "'You and Fiona planned all this?'". The display text is "'So you and Widow Fiona planned all this? You knew she was really working for the — for my father?' you ask. Your head is spinning with conspiracies; no one is who they seem to be.[paragraph break]'Fiona and I have known each other for a long time,' Dame Sandler says, 'since before you were born. She sought my help when your father died. We had our suspicions even then, and we made plans in case the worst should come to pass.'"

DS36 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Suspicions?'". The display text is "'Suspicions?' you ask. 'Suspicions of what?'[paragraph break]Dame Sandler looks down at her hands for a long time. When she looks up at you again, you are shocked to see tears in her eyes. 'Fossville may have murdered your father.'"
The following quip is DS41.

DS37 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Why is Fossville after me?'". The display text is "'But why does Fossville hate me so much?' you cry. 'I just don't understand any of this — I've never done anything to him!'"
The following quip is DS38.

DS38 is a quip. The display text is "Dame Sandler sighs and her expression turns serious. 'What you must realize, Jacqueline, is that you represent a threat to certain people with ambitions toward the throne. The laws of ascension in our land are quite clear: in the absence of a named successor, the ruler is determined by the will of the people.'[paragraph break]She gives you a long, significant look. 'The Duke — your father — was very popular with the common people. Baron Fossville... is not.'[paragraph break]Your mouth goes dry, and the floor seems to tilt beneath your feet for a moment. 'Are you saying...'[paragraph break]'Yes,' says Dame Sandler. 'I am saying that you have a credible claim to the throne.'"

DS39 is a quip. The menu text is "'That's ridiculous.'". The display text is "You try to catch your breath, but it's all you can do to keep from bursting out into hysterical giggles. 'But that's just... ridiculous,' you say. 'Completely ridiculous. I can't take the [i]throne[r], I'm just an orphan, a street girl, a [i]nobody[r]...'[paragraph break]'You are the daughter of one of the most loved and respected noblemen in living memory,' Dame Sandler says quietly. 'If the Duke were alive today there is no question that he would take the Ascension if he so desired it. As his heir — even as his illegitimate heir — much of that esteem would fall to you. Many would think you worthy.'"

DS40 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Is that the only reason Fossville hates me?'". The display text is "'So that's it? That's why Fossville hates me and wants to lock me away?' you ask. 'Because he thinks I'll get the throne instead of him?'[paragraph break]Dame Sandler looks down at her hands for a long time. 'There may be one other reason,' she says. 'Many suspect this, but few will speak of it.' When she looks up at you again, you are shocked to see tears in her eyes. 'Fossville may have murdered your father.'"
The following quip is DS41.

DS41 is a quip. The display text is "Your stomach feels as though you are falling down a deep hole, but on the outside, you are still and calm. You think you should be surprised, but somehow, you know you had been expecting this all along.[paragraph break]'How did he do it?' you whisper.[paragraph break]'Poison seems most obvious,' Dame Sandler says, regaining a measure of control. 'But no one really knows. There's never been any proof.'[paragraph break]You nod. You feel anger, but it's a smoldering, far away anger. It is something you will have to deal with later. Right now, there are too many other things you need to know."

DS42 is a quip. The menu text is "'How would I take the throne?'". The display text is "'Even if I do have a... a credible claim to the throne,' you ask, 'what would I do with it? How am I supposed to take the Ascension? I can't just walk around Grubber's Market shouting, [i]I'm the Duke's daughter, vote for me![r]' You think about it for a moment, then add, 'Can I?'[paragraph break]Dame Sandler smiles. 'Well, the other thing you must realize is that there are also a number of people who are interested in seeing you succeed, and who can help you press your claim. Some of them may believe that you are the better candidate; more of them simply want to spite Fossville; all of them will expect you to be appropriately grateful for their aid should you actually succeed. It is a very valuable commodity, the gratitude of a queen.'"

DS43 is a quip. The menu text is "'I can't do this.'". The display text is "You shake your head. 'I can't do this. I can't rule a kingdom, it's... it's just insane.'[paragraph break]Dame Sandler puts a hand on your arm. 'I realize this is a bit sudden and frightening, my dear, but you must accept it and act quickly.' Her voice is soothing, but firm. 'This will not simply go away. Fossville does not care whether you want the Ascension. He will hunt you down regardless. So why not take him head-on? This is who you are, now. Enjoy it, play it to the hilt.'"

DS44 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do I have to do?'". The display text is "You take a long, deep breath. Part of you still can't believe this is even happening. But you hear yourself saying, 'All right. What do I have to do?'[paragraph break]'Before you can enlist anyone's aid,' says Dame Sandler, 'you must let it be known that you are in the game, and that you are a player worth backing. You must announce yourself. And to do that, you must attend Fossville's ball tonight.'[paragraph break]In spite of everything that's happened, you find yourself smiling at the idea of attending a royal ball.[paragraph break]'Of course, you cannot attend the ball looking like this,' Dame Sandler says, her tone becoming brisk and businesslike again. 'You will need three things: a dress, some jewelry... and a weapon.'"

DS45 is a quip. The menu text is "'Where can I get a dress?'". The display text is "You look down at the dress you're wearing, the one Shannon found in Red Gate Estate.[paragraph break]'You mean this dress isn't good enough?' you ask, a bit hurt. 'Where can I get a better one?'[paragraph break]Dame Sandler smiles sympathetically. 'It's very nice, Jacqueline, but I'm afraid it's just a little bit out of fashion. The clothier right next door should be able to fit you with something more appropriate.'"

DS46 is a quip. The menu text is "'Why do I need a weapon?'". The display text is "'A weapon?' you ask. 'Why do I need a weapon at a fancy ball?'[paragraph break]'I admit it's unlikely that Fossville would try to kill you in front of a hundred guests,' Dame Sandler says drily, 'but you can never be too careful. There's a weapons dealer on Commerce Street who should have what you need.'"

DS47 is a quip. The menu text is "'How am I going to pay for this?'". The display text is "'I appreciate your advice, Dame Sandler,' you say, 'but how am I going to pay for all this? I don't have any money.'[paragraph break]'Ah, but you have something even better than money, Jacqueline,' Dame Sandler says. 'You have credibility. Go to the Chorus Brothers here in Lord's Market. Show them proof of your heritage, and they should be more than willing to help you with money.'"

DS48 is a quip. The menu text is "'Where can I get some jewelry?'". The display text is "'Where am I going to get some jewelry?' you ask. It occurs to you that you had a very nice necklace, but then you gave it to a monkey...[paragraph break]'Let me take care of that,' Dame Sandler says. She unlocks the display case with a tiny silver key, lifts up the lid, and gestures to the sparkling jewels within. 'Take any one you like, child. I'm one of those who would see you succeed; this is my gift to you.'"

DS49 is a quip. The menu text is "'Thank you.'". The display text is "'I hardly know what to say, Dame Sandler,' you breathe. 'Thank you.'[paragraph break]She merely smiles and inclines her head. 'Now hurry — Fossville's ball is tonight, and there's not much time left. See the moneylenders first, then get a suitable dress and a discreet blade. Pieter will go with you—'[paragraph break]Pieter blinks. 'What, to the ball?' he asks.[paragraph break]'Yes, Pieter,' Sandler says pointedly, 'to the ball. Just do what you always do — keep your mouth shut and make sure no one harms the valuables.'[paragraph break]She turns back to you and smiles 'Go, child, and good luck.'"

DS49B is a quip. The display text is "'A fine choice,' says Dame Sandler, closing and locking the case once again."

PI2 is a quip. The menu text is "'Did you know I was a girl, too?'". The display text is "'So did Dame Sandler keep you in the dark,' you ask, 'or did you know I was a girl all this time, too?'[paragraph break]Pieter looks so confused and uncomfortable, you have to suppress a smile. 'Oh, I was in the dark, all right. To tell you the truth, it's a bit of a shock, seeing you like this... er, Jacqueline.'"

PI3 is a quip. The menu text is "'Do you really think I could be Queen?'". The display text is "'All that stuff Dame Sandler was saying, about me having a credible claim... do you think I could really do that?' you ask. 'Take the Ascension, become Queen?'[paragraph break]Pieter sighs. 'To tell you the truth, Jacqueline — Goddesses, but it's weird calling you that — to tell you the truth, I don't know much about Royal politics at all. But if Dame Sandler says you have a chance at it, then I'd guess that you do. It wouldn't be the most far-fetched thing I ever heard that turned out to be true.'"

PI4 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of Dame Sandler?'". The display text is "[first time]'What do you think of Dame Sandler?' you ask.[paragraph break]'She took me in when no one else would hire me,' says Pieter, 'on account of some bad business that happened back east, and don't bother asking about it by the way. She's the shrewdest, toughest, fairest woman I ever met. I'd lay down my life for that lady. And if she wants you protected, then by the Goddesses you'll have nothing to fear from anyone.'[subsequently][rp] 'she's as good an ally as you could ask for.'[only]"

PI5 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of Baron Fossville?'".

PI6 is a quip. The menu text is "'What did you think of my father?'". The display text is "[first time]'I guess you remember when my father ruled the city,' you remark. 'What did you think of him, Pieter?'[paragraph break]'I thought he was a just ruler,' Pieter says. 'I'd have had him for king gladly, if he were still alive. You could do worse for a father, Jacqueline. And I suppose he could have done worse for a daughter,' he adds with a smile.[subsequently][rp] 'he was a good man, and I think he'd be proud of you.'[only]"

PI7 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you know about fancy balls?'". The display text is "[first time]'Well, Pieter, you ever been to a fancy dress ball, before?' you ask. 'What can we expect?'[paragraph break]Pieter spreads his hands in a shrug. 'I'm afraid I won't be much help, Jacqueline — I'm not very comfortable at parties.

'Anyway. That one,' he says, pointing to a plain-handled blade about six inches long. 'That's the one you want.'[paragraph break]Olgan Minor grumbles, but Pieter glares at him again and suggests that if your gold is no good here, then perhaps some other metal might suit the shopkeeper better.

Section 1 - Description

Jacobs the Elder is a proper-named, male ballgoer.

The description of Jacobs the Elder is "Jacobs is a large man like his son, though age and indulgence have made him less imposing.

JE1 is a quip. The display text is "'Well now, look who we have here,' says a gruff voice behind you. 'You must be the girl my son helped out of prison recently.' You turn and are startled to see a familiar face — it's Jacobs, your former cellmate from the jailhouse![paragraph break]Then you realize — no, it's not him. This man has the same heavy brow and hulking build, but he's older, more jowly, and his hair is gray at the temples. This must be Jacobs['] father, the wealthy and notorious merchant."

JE2 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'It was the other way around, actually.'". The display text is "[i]What would Dame Sandler do in this situation?[r] you wonder. You decide to play it cool and tricky. 'Funny,' you say. 'I remember it was me who helped your son out of prison.'"
The following quip is JE5.

JE3 is a quip. The menu text is "'And how is your son lately?'". The display text is "'And how is your son lately, Master Jacobs?' you ask. 'Staying out of prison?' [i]And improving his lock picking skills, one hopes,[r] you resist the urge to add.[paragraph break]Jacobs shrugs. 'I make no excuses for my prodigy,' he says. 'He's his own man, and answers to no one. Just like his father.'"

JE4 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'How do you know who I am?'". The display text is "This man's apparent familiarity with your situation is making you decidedly nervous. 'How do you know about that?' you ask, in a low, tight voice. 'How do you know who I am?'"
The following quip is JE5.

JE5 is a quip. The display text is "He holds up a pudgy, ring-encrusted hand. 'Don't bother denying it, I have informants everywhere. I know exactly who you are... and [I]why[R] you were in a prison cell.' Jacobs laughs. 'Don't worry, I've no plans to reveal your presence to Fossville.'"

JE6 is a quip. The menu text is "'I thought you were a crook.'". The display text is "'I've heard you're a crook and a pirate,' you say, suspiciously. 'Why should I trust you?'[paragraph break]Jacob the Elder's face hardens. 'I'm a businessman,' he says loftily, 'with many diversified interests. Whatever else anyone may tell you is a pernicious lie. And I wouldn't turn you over to Fossville in any case because there's nothing in it for me. He will almost certainly find out about it soon enough without my help.'"

JE7 is a quip. The menu text is "'Then what do you want?'". The display text is "'If you're not here to blow the whistle on me, then what do you want?' you ask.[paragraph break]Jacobs the Elder smiles and leans close to you, close enough that you can smell the spiced wine on his breath. 'The way I see it, you owe my son quite a favor,' he murmurs in your ear. 'The way I see it, you'll be owing many people favors before you're done. But if you're to start off well, you'll need to know who those people are.[paragraph break]'Over there for example, is the Queen,' Jacobs says, pointing across the room to a woman you can barely see for all the servants and courtiers pressed around her. 'She knows who you are, too. Best to not cross her path tonight, though I doubt you'll get close enough even if you try.'[paragraph break]He points out a beautiful young woman who seems to be deliberately ignoring the fact that you're staring at her. 'And there's her daughter, working the room,' he says. 'She's Fossville's quarry tonight, but every warm-blooded male with an ounce of ambition will be trying to woo her anyway.'[paragraph break]Slowly, Jacobs turns you full circle, pointing out notable guests as they come into view. 'The Duke and Duchess of Inhyron, in the Seven Lakes region. An old family, very influential. Insufferably snobbish, as well, but at least they liked your father. And there's the Baron and Baroness of Amhyron. You'll like them; they're a bit less formal, and less likely to hold your lack of upbringing against you. On the other hand, they are utterly beholden to the Inhyron Duchy. Then there's the Earl of Bresa,' Jacobs sighs. 'A merchant lord from the Kozar Delta. A foolish man with a purchased title. He has all the money in the world, but no power, because he is utterly indiscriminate in how he spends it.'[paragraph break]He turns back to you. 'Those are the players of the game in this room, and you will have to spar with all of them if you want to win.'"

JE9 is a quip. The menu text is "'Why are you telling me this?'". The display text is "'I still don't understand,' you say. 'Why are you telling me this? Why are you helping me?'[paragraph break]Jacobs the Elder shrugs. 'I'll be frank,' he says, 'you're a long shot. I don't blame you for trying to capitalize on your father's legacy, but you must know that your chances of doing so successfully are next to zero. Still, I didn't get to be where I am today without laying a few coins down on the occasional dark horse. A bit of free advice is no skin off my nose, and maybe you'll remember it if, by some outside whim of the Goddesses, you actually get somewhere.'"

JE10 is a quip. The menu text is "'But what do I have to do?'". The display text is "'But how do I [']win?[']' you ask, feeling a bit lost. 'What am I supposed to say to these people?'[paragraph break]Jacobs puts his hand on your arm. 'The bottom line, my dear girl, is this: unless you have an army at your beck and call, which you clearly do not, you cannot take the throne by yourself. It's all about how many allies you have, and there is only one way to bring people over to your side. It doesn't matter if they like you; it doesn't even matter if they think you'd make a good Queen. All that matters is whether they think you'll repay them well if they help you.'"

JE11 is a quip. The display text is "Suddenly he claps you on the back in a most uncourtly manner. 'Well, that should be enough to get you started. Good luck, my girl.' And he wanders off, chuckling, to mingle with the other guests."

JE12 is a quip. The display text is "Jacobs raises an eyebrow and purses his thick lips as you approach. 'Back for more, hmm?'"

JE13 is a quip. The menu text is "'What else can you tell me about Fossville?'". The display text is "'Since you're not going to turn me in, why don't you tell me more about Baron Fossville?' you ask.[paragraph break]Jacobs chuckles. 'I have to admit, Fossville has guts. I don't think there's a person here that doesn't at least suspect that he poisoned your father. Except for Bresa, perhaps,' he adds, rolling his eyes. 'No, tonight Fossville is sending a message. He's letting the others know that he knows that they know, and it makes no difference to his plans. He's hoping this show of confidence will sway them over to his side.'[paragraph break]He takes a long swig of wine. 'On the other hand,' he muses, 'maybe he planned this whole thing just to trap you.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'this ball is to show his rivals that he has what it takes to be King.'"

JE14 is a quip. The menu text is "'Can you tell me anything about my father?'". The display text is "'Can you tell me anything about my father?' you ask.[paragraph break]Jacobs smirks. 'The old Duke spent too much time worrying about his subjects, and not enough time worrying about who else might want to rule them. He left himself open. You'd do well to remember that.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'your father was a good man, but too trusting.'"

JE15 is a quip. The menu text is "'Tell me about the Queen.'". The display text is "'Tell me about the Queen,' you say.[paragraph break]'Fossville thinks the Queen is here to endorse his courtship of the Princess,' Jacobs explains. 'But in fact, what she's doing is watching everyone else to see how they react to his schemes. She has no qualms about marrying her daughter to a murderer, but not if there's a chance it might not work out for her politically. Of course, the one thing the Queen hates more than anything else is an unexpected hitch in her plans.' He smiles and points his chubby finger. 'And that would be you, my dear girl.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'the Queen will not make any moves yet. Tonight, she merely watches the field.'"

JE16 is a quip. The menu text is "'Tell me about the Princess.'". The display text is "'Tell me about the Princess,' you say.[paragraph break]'The Princess is an opportunist,' says Jacobs, 'and she sees Fossville as her best chance. There's even been rumors that she's been trying to help the Baron raise money. Anyway, I can't imagine she is very happy to see you here,' he adds. 'You and she are competing for the same position, now. And you know how jealous girls can get.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'she will do anything to win the Ascension. Watch her carefully.'"

JE17 is a quip. The menu text is "'Tell me about the Duke of Inhyron.'". The display text is "'Tell me about the Duke of Inhyron,' you say.[paragraph break]'Duke Inhyron is a stuffed shirt and a hypocrite,' Jacobs says with a sour face. 'He'd like you to think that he's above all this petty politicking, that he's only here to respect the old Duke's memory, but he's looking for an angle just like everyone else. He has a son of his own, and he'd like nothing better than to marry the little brat into whichever family seizes the throne.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'the Duke is here to further his own interests, just like everyone else.'"

JE18 is a quip. The menu text is "'Tell me about the Baron of Amhyron.'". The display text is "'Tell me about the Baron of Amhyron,' you say.[paragraph break]'The Baron of Amhyron is that rarest of breeds,' says Jacobs, 'honest, good-hearted, and an effective ruler. Most folks only manage, at most, two out of three.' Jacobs thinks for a moment. 'The Baron might actually be a good ally for you to cultivate, but you'd need to tread carefully. The Inhyrons gifted his family their lands two generations ago, and they've never let him forget it. He is bound to support their interests whether he likes it or not.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'Baron Amhyron would be a good ally, if only he were free to act on his own.'"

JE19 is a quip. The menu text is "'Tell me about the Earl of Bresa.'". The display text is "'Tell me about the Earl of Bresa,' you say.[paragraph break]Jacobs snorts, spraying a mouthful of wine on a passing partygoer. 'Bresa is a fat idiot,' he says, flatly. 'He thinks that by throwing coins about like bird feed, he will create many allies. Instead he creates spongers who know they can get anything from him without providing anything in return. Ignore him; he's useless.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'the Earl is useless. Ignore him.'"

JE20 is a quip. The menu text is "'Good-bye.'". The display text is "'Thank you for your advice, Master Jacobs,' you say. 'I think I'll wander around and play the game with one of the other guests.'[paragraph break]Jacobs nods his head as you leave. 'Always a pleasure, my dear girl.'"

Chapter 2 - The Queen

The Queen is a female ballgoer. The indefinite article of the Queen is "the".

The distant description of the Queen is "Her Royal Majesty is not a tall lady, and most of the time all you can see of her is a flash of golden crown or silver hair glimpsed between the shoulders of her entourage. But every now and then the shoulders part, and you get a good look at her: a pale, angry-looking woman with sharp, shrewish features. Her tiny face is almost lost within the explosion of jewel-encrusted brocade and lace that geysers up from the collar of her gown[first time].[paragraph break]Then, for just a moment, her gaze meets yours. Her stern expression never changes, but her eyes seem to flash a warning. [i]I'm watching you,[no line break][r]she seems to say. [i]Do not cross me[r][only]." Understand "royal", "majesty", "woman", "lady" as the Queen.

Before doing something other than examining with the Queen:
	say "With so many people crowding around trying to get the Queen's attention, you can't even get near her." instead;

Chapter 3 - The Princess

Section 1 - Description

The Princess is a female ballgoer. The indefinite article of the Princess is "the". The description is "The Princess is tall, shapely, and wisp-thin, wearing a long gown of wine-colored silk embroidered with amethysts. She's beautiful, but she's also haughty, and the way she looks down her nose at you with those cold, blue eyes irritates you to no end. After all, she's only a few years older than you are — what (besides her title and her piles of riches) makes [i]her[r] so special?"

The distant description of the Princess is "Even from across the room, the Princess commands attention; wherever she mingles, conversations stop, and men's eyes follow her. Strangely, she still seems to be avoiding your gaze, although why she would be discomfited by one person when everyone else is openly staring at her is beyond you."

A wine-colored silk gown is worn by the Princess. The description is "You hate to admit it, but her dress is quite simply stunning." Understand "dress", "amythest", "amythests", "wine", "coloured", "colored" as the wine-colored silk gown.

PR2 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'I'm not a street urchin.'". The display text is "'I am not a street urchin,' you say coldly. Sure, technically you were one just yesterday, but you don't have to take that from [i]her[r]. 'I am the daughter of a Duke, and I'd ask that you address me with some respect.'" The following quip is PR5.

PR3 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'You should be afraid of me.'". The display text is "'You should be afraid of me, you know,' you say, trying to show some bravado. 'Even if you are the Princess, that doesn't mean you have any greater claim to the throne than I do. And you have fewer supporters than you think, too. Fossville isn't well loved around here.'" The following quip is PR5.

PR4 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'So, do you like parties?'". The display text is "'So...' You flounder, struggling to think of something to say. 'This is a pretty nice place. Do you, uh, like, uh... balls?'" The following quip is PR5.

PR5 is a quip. The display text is "The Princess looks at you incredulously and curls her lip. 'Are you, like, actually trying to have a [i]conversation[r] with me?' she asks."

PR6 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Yes, I am.'". The display text is "'Yes, your Highness, I am,' you say, determined not to be put off. 'It seems to me that getting to know to each other might be to our mutual benefit, even if we do find ourselves at odds.'" The following quip is PR9.

PR7 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Did you know that Fossville is a murderer?'". The display text is "You press your advantage. 'So how does it feel to be courting a murderer?' you ask.

PR8 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'It must be nice, being a Princess.'".

The following quip is PR9.

PR9 is a quip. The display text is "The Princess looks away, holding one hand delicately against the side of her face as though suffering from a royal headache. 'Oh, Goddesses,' she moans, 'this is so embarrassing.'"

PR10 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'I know, I know!'". The display text is "You find yourself nodding eagerly. 'I know, isn't it?' you say. 'I've been feeling terribly awkward almost from the moment I started talking to you.'" The following quip is PR15.

PR11 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'I'm sorry I've made you so uncomfortable.'". The display text is "'I'm sorry I've made your Highness so uncomfortable,' you say, letting just the slightest hint of sarcasm into your voice.

But I'm really not interested in listening to some dressed-up alley rat chatter at me all night. So if you'll excuse me...' And then she shoulders past you and disappears into the crowd."

PR16 is a quip. The display text is "'If you'll excuse me, your Highness,' you say, dropping an awkward curtsey, 'I would take your leave-'[paragraph break]'Oh, thank the Goddesses,' she snaps, shouldering past you and disappearing into the crowd."

Rule for making excuses in favor of someone when the current conversationalist is the Princess:
	carry out the firing activity with PR16;

The response of PR1 is { PR2, PR3, PR4 }. 

The response of PR5 is { PR6, PR7, PR8 }.

	do nothing;

	change the chosen opening gambit to IN1.

	change the chosen opening gambit to IN15.

Instead of talking to the Duke of Inhyron when IN14 is fired:

Instead of talking to the Duchess of Inhyron when the current conversationalist is the Duke of Inhyron:
	say "The Duchess shrinks back, as though startled that you would deign to speak to her at all.";

Before talking to the Duchess of Inhyron when the current conversationalist is not the Duke of Inhyron:
	change the noun to the Duke of Inhyron;

IN1 is a quip. The display text is "Duke Inhyron inclines his head as you approach. 'No need for introductions,' he says sternly. 'I am aware of who you are, and I see no reason to incriminate either of us by announcing it.' He looks you up and down with only a slight squint of disapproval. 'Your father was a good ruler and a good man,' he says, 'and though I do not think you have what it takes to fill his shoes, he was a friend, and you are his kin. So there we are. What would you ask of me, girl?'"

IN2 is a quip. The menu text is "'You don't like me very much, do you?'". The display text is "'I get the impression that you don't like me very much,' you say, making an effort to stay polite and unruffled. 'Would you care to tell me why?'[paragraph break]The Duke gives a short, exasperated sigh. 'Very well. I do not feel it is appropriate for you to pursue the Ascension given the... [i]circumstances[r] surrounding your birth. I am not partisan; I have no personal stake in who is chosen to take the throne. However, there are proper, traditional methods for going about it. I would see your father's memory honored properly. If you can convince me that coming out publicly as your his illegitimate heir for political gain would somehow not besmirch his family name, then I might be persuaded to look more favorably on your endeavors.'"

IN3 is a quip. The menu text is "'You were a friend of my father?'". The display text is "'You were a friend of my father?' you ask. You find it hard to believe that your father would have been friendly with this stuck-up chauvinist.[paragraph break]'I counted your father as a friend and an equal,' says the Duke. 'It pained me to learn of his moral lapse, but none of us are perfect, I suppose. What's done is done, and I do not judge him.'"

IN4 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?'". The display text is "'What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?' you ask.[paragraph break]The Duke gives you a look of withering contempt. 'Jacobs is a common gangster. I'm having difficulty imagining how a conversation about him could possibly be fruitful.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'I have nothing to say about Jacobs. Let us talk about something else.'"

IN5 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you know about Baron Fossville?'". The display text is "'What do you know about Baron Fossville?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Fossville can be a bit uncouth, I admit, but he has good breeding,' the Duke says. 'I've no specific reason to think that he wouldn't be a good candidate for the ascension, although I am open to the possibility of alternatives.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'Fossville comes from a respectable family and I see no reason not to endorse his claim to the throne.'"

IN6 is a quip. The menu text is "'Don't you know Fossville murdered my father?'". The display text is "Unable to keep the acid tone out of your voice, you ask, 'It doesn’t bother you that Fossville murdered my father?'[paragraph break]The Duke looks a bit uncomfortable. 'There is no evidence that he did any such thing,' he says finally. 'Only malicious rumors spread by the Baron's political enemies. Among which, I feel compelled to point out, you now number yourself. You must admit, it would be very convenient for you if it became widely believed that Baron Fossville is a murderer, whether or not such a thing were actually true.' He smiles infuriatingly and spreads his hands. 'I am merely trying to remain objective. It would be irresponsible of me to not take these things into consideration.'"

IN7 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you know about the Queen?'". The display text is "'What do you know about the Queen?' you ask.[paragraph break]'I have the utmost regard for Her Majesty,' says the Duke, glancing over at the woman, 'and I respect her judgment. I expect that her opinion and my own are in accordance on many things, particularly with regard to the Ascension. Which is not to say that she and I have never disagreed, but it would take a strong argument to convince me that she was wrong.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'I respect the Queen's judgment.'"

IN8 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think about the Princess?'". The display text is "'What do you think about the Princess?' you ask.[paragraph break]The Duke smiles. 'She is a fine young lady, with the most respectable of bloodlines, obviously. My own son has only just turned nine; otherwise I myself would be petitioning on his behalf for the Princess's hand.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'she is a most respectable young lady.'"

IN9 is a quip. The menu text is "'What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?'". The display text is "'What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?' you ask.[paragraph break]'My grandfather granted the Baron's grandfather his title and lands more than half a century ago,' the Duke informs you. 'Since then, the Amhyrons have fulfilled their vassal obligations more than adequately. I sometimes fear that the Baron is too lenient with his subjects, especially in the area of moral guidance, but that is his own concern. So long as the King's Law is enforced and taxes are levied, I am content to merely set an example and allow others to emulate it as they see fit.'"

IN10 is a quip. The menu text is "'Why don't you let Baron Amhyron follow his own interests?'". The display text is "'According to Jacobs, you won't let the Baron sneeze without your say-so,' you remark. 'Is it really necessary to keep him so beholden to you? Why don't you let him follow his own interests?'[paragraph break]The Duke stiffens, clearly furious at the idea of someone like Jacobs (or even, you realize, someone like you) gossiping about him. 'The traditions of vassalage are ancient and intricately bound to concepts of honor and moral duty, so it does not surprise me that Jacobs has such a poor understanding of them,' he snaps. 'But fundamental to this tradition is the idea of loyalty. Without loyalty, we are all weakened. If you cannot grasp that, then I have little optimism for your chances for the throne.'"

IN11 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?'". The display text is "'What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?' you ask.[paragraph break]'The Earl of Bresa is a sterling example of what happens when material wealth is divorced from proper family lineage,' sniffs the Duke. 'People of his class were never meant to wield power, and have no idea how to properly do so.'"

IN12 is a quip. The menu text is "'You say you have a son?'". The display text is "'Do I understand correctly Your Grace, that you have a young son?' you ask.[paragraph break]The Duke puffs himself up. 'That's right. He'll be ten years old come this autumn, and already he is a strapping lad, a credit to his bloodline.'"

IN13 is a quip. The menu text is "'I might be willing to marry him.'". The display text is "Choosing your words carefully, you say, 'Since bloodlines are so important to you, I'm sure you're aware of the advantages of marrying into a Royal one. If I win the Ascension, I could make that happen for you.'[paragraph break]The Duke, for once, looks speechless.[paragraph break]You clear your throat and hurry on. 'Think about it, Your Grace. The Princess strikes me as someone who would be very particular about who she married, but I won't have the luxury of being picky. Of course, I am illegitimate... but I'd still be the Queen. And that's what really matters, right?'[paragraph break]The Duke stares at you for a long time, then gives a short, curt bow. 'I will remember that,' he says, then turns stiffly and strides away. His wife scurries after him.[paragraph break]You take a deep breath and try to swallow the nasty taste in your mouth. You've just promised to marry the nine-year-old son of a conceited, condescending bigot. But that might just make the difference when it's time for the Duke to decide whom he's going to support for the Ascension.[paragraph break]You have a feeling that Dame Sandler would be pleased. You're not exactly sure that makes you happy."

IN14 is a quip. The menu text is "'Well, keep him away from me.'". The display text is "You nod. 'Well, if I do become Queen — and I just might, you know — do me a favor and keep him far away from me. In fact, if I have anything to say about it, I'll make sure there's not a respectable family in the kingdom who'll have anything to do with him. It would be worth it to see the look on your face when your son is forced to marry some illegitimate street urchin just to keep your family name going.'[paragraph break]The Duke's face goes purple. 'I will remember this,' he chokes out, then turns on his heel and strides away. His wife scurries after him.[paragraph break]'Except that I'd probably feel too sorry for the street urchin!' you shout after him. Your blood is up and you're breathing hard. You've completely ruined your chances of getting the Duke's support now, of course, but you don’t care — it felt so good to put that conceited, condescending bigot in his place."

IN15 is a quip. The display text is "Duke Inhyron nods as you approach. 'Yes, girl? What is it now?'"

IN16 is a quip. The menu text is "'Good-bye.'". The display text is "'If you'll excuse me, Your Grace,' you say, trying a small curtsey, 'I think I'll speak with some of the other guests.'[paragraph break]The Duke nods politely as you leave."

The Baron of Amhyron is a male ballgoer. The description of the Baron of Amhyron is "Baron Amhyron is middle-aged, somewhat stout, with a red face and kind crinkles around his deep, brown eyes.

AM1 is a quip. The display text is "Amhyron smiles as you approach. 'Good evening, milady,' he says, bowing and taking your hand. 'I don't believe I've had the pleasure of an introduction. I am Lord Falton, Baron of Amhyron. And you are?'[paragraph break]'Lady Jacqueline,' you manage, 'of, er... of Toresal.'[paragraph break]The Baron's eyebrows lift slightly. 'Do tell. How... intriguing. How may I be of service to you this evening, Lady Jacqueline?'"

AM2 is a quip. The menu text is "'I'm surprised you don't know who I am.'". The display text is "'I'm surprised you don't know who I am already,' you say with a smile. 'It sometimes seems like everyone else here does.'[paragraph break]'I didn't recognize you at first, no,' says the Baron, 'But I can't say I've never heard of you. There were rumors that the old Duke Toresal had a child hidden away somewhere, but I never gave them much thought. As to why you're here, I think I can guess.' He smiles. 'I suppose you're something of a stick in Fossville's spokes. Aren't you worried he'll come after you?'"

AM3 is a quip. The menu text is "'He's already tried.'". The display text is "'He's already tried, more than once,' you say, proudly. 'He hasn't caught me yet.'[paragraph break]The Baron's smile broadens. 'You certainly seem like a capable young woman,' he says. 'I suppose it's him I should be worried about.'"

AM4 is a quip. The menu text is "'He doesn't know I'm here.'". The display text is "'I doubt it,' you say. 'I don't think he even knows I'm here. I kind of snuck in through the back door,' you confide.[paragraph break]The Baron frowns slightly. 'But he'll find out soon enough, especially with everyone at the ball talking about you. And they are definitely talking about you, by the way,' he adds, with a slight smile. 'You should probably be more careful.'"

AM5 is a quip. The menu text is "'You look like you'd rather be somewhere else.'". The display text is "'You look like you'd rather be somewhere else,' you say. 'In fact, if you don't mind my saying so, you're the only person I've met so far who looks as uncomfortable as I feel. I thought a nobleman like yourself would be right at home at a fancy party like this.'[paragraph break]The Baron spreads his hands and shrugs. 'I'm something of an outsider here, I'm afraid,' he says. 'Just like you. I'm not very good at idle conversation, and I'm not important enough for anyone to want to chat me up.'"

AM6 is a quip. The menu text is "'Would you support me in the Ascension?'". The display text is "Something about the Baron's manner puts you at ease, and you decide to take the direct approach. 'Listen,' you say, 'uh, milord. The only reason I'm here is because I need allies. I don't have very many, and the truth is, I'm not very good at getting more, and I'm getting kind of desperate. So I'm going to come right out and say it. You know who I am... would you be willing to support me in the Ascension?'[paragraph break]The Baron, who has listened to you carefully throughout your whole speech, looks down at the floor and sighs.[paragraph break]'Thank you for your candor, Lady Jacqueline,' he says finally, looking you in the eye. 'I will try to be equally honest. I'd support just about anyone against Fossville. And I would be overjoyed to support the heir of Duke Toresal most especially. Unfortunately, that may not mean very much. I couldn't garner much more support beyond my own single vote, first of all. I haven't the influence.'[paragraph break]The Baron pauses, then looks away. 'And secondly, I can't oppose Duke Inhyron's interests without putting myself in jeopardy,' he says quietly. 'He's the one you need to convince, not me.'"

AM7 is a quip. The menu text is "'Why can't you act against Inhyron?'". The display text is "'What makes you so beholden to Inhyron?' you ask. 'Can't you speak your own mind?'[paragraph break]'Oh, I speak my mind often,' the Baron says quickly. 'Everyone pretty much ignores me. Or else they smile condescendingly and say how nice it is that the common folk have someone to represent their interests. And so it goes.'[paragraph break]He heaves another sigh. 'As for why I am so beholden, my family's land and titles were gifted by Inhyron's ancestor. That means he can remove them whenever he likes.'"

AM8 is a quip. The menu text is "'Would that be so bad?'". The display text is "'Would it be so bad if he did?' you press. 'You can't be happy serving under him like that.'[paragraph break]'You're right, I'm not very happy,' concedes the Baron. 'I'd give it all away, lands and title, except... except if Inhyron removed me, he'd replace me with someone worse — probably himself. I've managed to do some good in my little corner of Miradania, and I don't want to leave my subjects to someone who's just going to treat them like... well, like peasants. Better to stay where I am and do what I can, then to make waves and lose the ability to do even that much.'"

AM9 is a quip. The menu text is "'If I become Queen, I could help you.'". The display text is "'If I became Queen, I could help you,' you point out. 'I could grant you Royal lands, or something. You could be independent of Inhyron.'[paragraph break]The Baron grins wrily. 'That would be wonderful,' he says. 'But you can't make me independent of the Duke until you're Queen. And to become Queen, you'll need support. And I can't support you until I'm independent of the Duke. And so it goes.' He chuckles. 'I'm afraid my hands are tied, Lady Jacqueline.'"

AM10 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you know about Fossville?'". The display text is "'What do you know about Fossville?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Hmm. Fossville, well.' The Baron pauses, carefully choosing his words. 'I don't like him. He is motivated purely by personal ambition; I don't think he cares a whit about the welfare of his subjects or about actually running the Kingdom, and that will spell disaster for Miradania if he takes the throne. That would be bad enough, but then there are the allegations about how the old Duke Toresal died... I would oppose his candidacy if I could, of course, but even then I'm afraid I wouldn't have enough influence for that to mean very much.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'I don't like him, but I can't openly oppose him if Inhyron supports him.'"

AM11 is a quip. The menu text is "'Did you know my father?'". The display text is "'Did you know my father?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Not personally, milady,' the Baron says, 'but from what I understand he was beloved by his subjects and respected by his fellow noblemen. Many people were sorry when he died.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'he was a good man and I was sorry when he passed on.'"

AM12 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of Jacobs?'". The display text is "'What do you think of Jacobs the Elder?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Jacobs is an... interesting character,' says the Baron. 'I'm not quite sure what to make of him, except that he's probably not one to trifle with. And certainly not one to make casual deals with, unless you enjoy losing the shirt off your back without ever realizing that you'd wagered it.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'he's a tricky fellow. I hope you didn't promise him anything.'"

AM13 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of the Queen?'". The display text is "'What do you think of the Queen?' you ask.[paragraph break]'The Queen is being short-sighted,' the Baron says. 'She's backing Fossville because she wants to maintain her family's dynasty, but she's not considering what that would mean for the Kingdom as a whole. I have no doubt that she'd as easily switch to some other candidate, but whomever she backs, she'll back for the wrong reasons.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'the Queen will back whomever helps her most politically, without regard for the consequences.'"

AM14 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of the Princess?'". The display text is "'What do you think of the Princess?' you ask. [paragraph break]The Baron smiles. 'Well, the Princess is young,' he says. 'You can't really blame her for wanting the same thing her mother wants, now can you?'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'the Princess is young. I tend to give her the benefit of the doubt for that.'"

AM15 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?'". The display text is "'What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?' you ask.[paragraph break]The Baron smiles ruefully. 'What do I think of him? I think he's an arrogant, self-righteous bigot who's obsessed with his family lineage to an unhealthy degree. And my family owes his family everything. So I keep my mouth shut.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'it's not a good idea for me to speak ill of the Duke.'"

AM16 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?'". The display text is "'What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?' you ask.[paragraph break]The Baron looks over to where the Earl is telling crude jokes and stuffing his face at the refreshment table. 'Oh, Bresa's a good fellow,' he says with a smile. 'He doesn't care for the social niceties, and that infuriates some peope. But he's smarter than most give him credit for.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'the Earl has his eccentricities, but he's as good a man as anyone here."

AM17 is a quip. The display text is "'Hello again, milady,' says the Baron with a slight bow. 'You are finding the festivities enjoyable, I  hope?'"

AM18 is a quip. The menu text is "'Good-bye'". The display text is "'I've enjoyed talking to you, milord Baron,' you say, and are surprised to find that you actually mean it. 'But if you'll excuse me, I should talk to some of the other guests for a while.'[paragraph break]'Of course,' the Baron says amiably. 'The pleasure has been all mine, Lady Jacqueline.'"

Chapter 6 - Earl of Bresa

The Earl of Bresa is a male ballgoer. The description of the Earl of Bresa is "The Earl of Bresa has a bald head and a huge, curly, red beard. His lavish, colorful clothes are stained with wine and food. He laughs too loudly and has a habit of putting his greasy fingers on other guests — usually a friendly slap on the back for the men, elsewhere for the women. Despite Jacobs['] warning, you find yourself liking him immediately." Understand "man" as the Earl of Bresa.

The distant description of the Earl of Bresa is "The Earl is easy to spot from anywhere in the room: he's the one roaring with laughter and throwing fistfuls of money at the chamber orchestra, much to the guests['] amusement and the musicians['] embarassment."

Section 2 - Conversation 

Rule for initiating conversation with the Earl of Bresa:
	if BR1 is unfired,
		change the chosen opening gambit to BR1;
	otherwise change the chosen opening gambit to BR11;

BR1 is a quip. The display text is "'Ah-HA!' Earl Bresa roars when he spots you. 'The young up-and-comer! The stick in the spokes! The crumb in everyone's eye!' He seems utterly unconcerned that anyone else might hear him — although it seems like most of the other guests are making an effort to ignore him anyway. 'Listen,' he says, putting his hand on your arm. 'I like you already. You need anything, backing, whatever, you just let me know. Now, what was it you wanted to talk about?'"

BR2 is a quip. The menu text is "'You're willing to support me?'". The display text is "'You mean you're willing to support me?' you ask, taken aback. 'Just like that? Without knowing anything about me?'[paragraph break]'Young lady,' the Earl slurs, 'I know one thing about you and one thing only, and it is the only thing I need to know: that you are an insufferable aggravation to nearly every influential person at this Goddess-forsaken party. And that makes you all right by me.'"

BR3 is a quip. The menu text is "'Don't you want anything in return?'". The display text is "'I don't want to seem ungrateful,' you say, 'but that seems like a strange reason to support anyone for the Ascension. Don't you want anything in return?[paragraph break]The Earl flaps his hand dismissively. 'Bah! What I want is good food and strong wine, and that I can buy. Why get involved in politics? Why break my back trying to curry favor with a pack of throne-sniffing hyenas who all hate me anyway? But you can stick in their craws in a way that I cannot, and for that, I will gladly back you.'"

BR4 is a quip. The menu text is "'What can you tell me about Baron Fossville?'". The display text is "'Can you tell me anything about Baron Fossville?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Fossville? A mere scarecrow, a wooden soldier, a coward.' rants the Earl. 'You know, they say he poisoned the old Duke. Er...' he wipes his mouth with his sleeve to hide his embarassment. 'Sorry to bring that up. My condolences and all that. But it wouldn't surprise me a bit if it were true. It would serve the Queen right to have that conniving weasel for a son-in-law.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'the man is a conniving weasel.'"

BR5 is a quip. The menu text is "'What can you tell me about my father?'". The display text is "'Did you know my father well?' you ask.[paragraph break]The Earl becomes sober for a rare moment. 'There was no finer man in the kingdom than your father, my girl' he says, putting his greasy hand on your arm. 'He was the one man I respected out of all of these stuffed peacocks. No one was his equal. Certainly not Fossville. Certainly not any of the backstabbing dandies parading around this room tonight.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'your father was a great man. Always remember that.'"

BR6 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think about Jacobs the Elder?'". The display text is "'What do you think about Jacobs the Elder?' you ask. 'He doesn't seem to have a very high opinion of you.'[paragraph break]'Why should I care what that self-inflated stallkeeper thinks of me?' yells the Earl, deliberately pitching his voice so that Jacobs, standing in a nearby corner of the room, can hear. 'He's just jealous of my title, is all.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'I [i]don't[r] think about Jacobs the Elder, if I can help it.'"

BR7 is a quip. The menu text is "'What can you tell me about the Queen?'". The display text is "'What can you tell me about the Queen?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Bah, the Queen's been all but useless ever since the King died,' the Earl says loudly, ignoring all the horrified stares. 'Now she's just desperate to remain relevant.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'the Queen's on her way out. That's good enough news for me.'"

BR8 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think about the Princess?'". The display text is "'What do you think about the Princess?' you ask.[paragraph break]The Earl gets a foolish grin on his face. 'Oh, she's a pretty thing, all right. I wouldn't mind marrying her myself, if it didn't mean moving in with her hungry old hag of a mother.' Then he opens his mouth and lets loose a long, ripping belch, as if to emphasize which features the young Princess might find most attractive."
The repeat text is "[rp] 'she's very pretty. What else do you want to know?'"

BR9 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?'". The display text is "'What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Oh, what a noble and proper gentleman is the Duke of Inhyron,' intones the Earl in grave tones. Then he throws back his head and roars, '[i]Balderdash![r] What a noble and proper heap of cow pies, more like! Always strutting about his precious lineages. He hates me, you know, because I'm [']low-born['] — which just means I earned my money the hard way instead of inheriting it from Mummy and Daddy — and even so I'm richer than he is. I flaunt it just to rub his pointy little nose in it.'[paragraph break]He leans close and 'whispers' loudly enough for guests over by the chamber orchestra to hear, 'Between you and me, I think the great Duke protests too much. Anyone that obsessed with bloodlines probably has something in his own that he'd rather people not know about.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'the Duke is a pompous fart who probably has a few dirty secrets of his own.'"

BR10 is a quip. The menu text is "'What do you think of the Baron of Amhyron?'". The display text is "'What do you think of the Baron of Amhyron?' you ask.[paragraph break]'Amhyron's a decent bloke,' grunts the Earl, 'but he's got no backbone. He lets Duke Inhyron pull his strings like a puppet, and he never says one word against it. He says he puts up with it for the good of his subjects, but really he's just afraid to make waves. He ought to stand up to the Duke for once in his life; it'd do him good.'"
The repeat text is "[rp] 'the Earl would be a better man if he could crawl out from under Inhyron's thumb.'"

BR11 is a quip. The display text is "'Hello again!' yells the Earl, swaying slightly as he waves you over."

BR12 is a quip. The menu text is "'Good-bye.'". The display text is "'It's been a pleasure,' you tell the Earl, 'but I should probably go annoy some of the other guests now.'[paragraph break]The Earl laughs with his mouth full of hors d'oeuvres. 'Spread the love around, my girl!' he calls after you."

Chapter 7 - Prince of Gravesal

Section 1 - Scene opening

Brief Encounter is a scene. Brief Encounter begins when Brief Respite ends.

After talking to a ballgoer when every ballgoer in the Ballroom is spoken to:
	stop the action;

When Brief Encounter begins:
	move the Prince of Gravesal to the ballroom;
	move the several mercenaries to the location;
	now the current conversationalist is the Prince of Gravesal;
	update the character list;
	start conversation with the Prince of Gravesal on GR1;

Section 2 - Description

The Prince of Gravesal is a male ballgoer. The description is "The Prince cuts such a striking figure, you can't imagine how you failed to notice him until now. Tall and slim, with smooth skin the color of strong tea and long, ink-black hair tied back at the nape of his neck. His clothes, though finely cut, are black as well, devoid of decoration except for a single garnet brooch pinning his cloak at the shoulder. He looks young, perhaps only a few years older than you. And something about his deep, brown eyes makes it difficult for you to concentrate..."

After talking to someone during Brief Encounter:
	if the noun is not the Prince of Gravesal,
		say "'Please stay,' the Prince says, his hand still gently holding your elbow. 'There's not much time left; grant me the pleasure of your company for just a few moments longer.'" instead;

A hawk brooch is worn by the Prince of Gravesal. The description is "The brooch is shaped like a hawk, and decorated with bright red garnets." The printed name is "brooch". Understand "garnet", "garnets", "red", "decoration" as the hawk brooch. 

A black cloak is worn by the Prince of Gravesal. The description is "The Prince's cloak and clothes are plain but handsome, and black as coal." The printed name is "cloak". Understand "clothes" as the black cloak.

Section 3 - Conversation

GR1 is a quip. The display text is "'Pardon me,' someone says in a low, strangely accented voice, and a hand touches your elbow. You turn to see a tall, dark-skinned man leaning close to you. 'Please forgive my forwardness,' he murmurs. 'I have been waiting for the right moment to speak to you for some time now, but I fear if I wait much longer, I will never get the chance.'[paragraph break]He nods towards the ballroom entrance — where several of Fossville's mercenaries are standing![paragraph break]'Allow me to introduce myself,' the stranger says, as though nothing at all were amiss. 'I am Prince Gravesal.'"

GR2 is a quip. The menu text is "'Who are you?'". The display text is "Jacobs never mentioned this guy, and you don't remember seeing this man in the ballroom until now. 'Who are you?' you demand.[paragraph break]'Merely an interested observer,' says the Prince with a hint of a smile. 'I have been watching you from afar, and watching the reactions of others to you. I am intrigued.'"

GR3 is a quip. The menu text is "'You've been watching me?'". The display text is "'You've been watching me?' you ask. You want to feel offended, but the way he's looking at you makes that difficult. 'Do you mean watching me in a creepy stalker way, or in a secretly working for Fossville way?'[paragraph break]The Prince chuckles. 'Neither, actually. Of course I know who you are and why you're here, but that's not what intrigues me. There's something... special about you. I could see it from the moment I laid eyes on you.'"

GR4 is a quip. The menu text is "'I'm special?'". The display text is "You raise one eyebrow. 'So I'm [']special['], huh? How so?'[paragraph break]The Prince looks away for a moment. 'It is... difficult to explain. People in my family have always been able to see these things. It's like an aura.' He looks directly at you again. 'You have... a highly [i]visible[r] fate.'"

GR5 is a quip. The menu text is "'Is this about the Ascension?'". The display text is "'And this has nothing to do with the Ascension?' you ask, trying to keep a note of healthy skepticism in your voice. 'You don't have some ulterior political motive? You're not looking for some sort of favor down the line?'[paragraph break]The Prince shrugs. 'My homeland is far from here,on the outermost edge of the kingdom. I doubt very much the outcome of the Ascension will make much of a difference to me one way or the other.' He looks right into your eyes in a way that makes a lump rise up in your throat. 'No, mainly I am interested in [i]you[r].'"

GR6 is a quip. The menu text is "'I have to get out of here.'". The display text is "'Look,' you say, glancing over at the mercenaries working their way through the crowd, 'this has been very interesting, but I have to get out of here before those mercenaries spot me.'[paragraph break]The Prince seems unconcerned. 'It seems they have all the exits blocked, and they're combing the crowd very thoroughly. They [i]will[r] catch you. Why not spend the moments before they do in pleasant conversation, instead of scampering futilely about?'[paragraph break]Even though every instinct you have is urging you to run, you do have to admit there's a certain insane logic to what the Prince is saying."

GR7 is a quip. The menu text is "'What is my fate?'". The display text is "'Okay then, I'll bite,' you say. 'What do you see in my highly [i]visible[r] fate?'[paragraph break]The Prince looks deeply into your eyes, and goosebumps ripple up your arms as his fingertips brush across your skin. 'I see a long journey ahead of you. And many trials.'[paragraph break]For just a moment, all you can see are his deep, brown eyes.[paragraph break]'And I see death,' he whispers.[paragraph break]The Prince suddenly glances over your shoulder and smiles. 'It would seem that your company is desired by someone with greater powers of persuasion than mine,' he says. He looks back at you. 'Thank you. I hope I will see you again.'[paragraph break]He bows deeply; his lips are cool against the back of your hand. And then he is lost in the crowd, as suddenly as he appeared.[paragraph break]A rough hand falls on your shoulder. 'Come with us, girl,' growls a familiar voice. 'The Baron asked us not to drag you out kicking and screaming, so let's not disappoint him, eh?'"

The response of GR1 is { GR2, GR3, GR6 }.

The response of GR2 is { GR3, GR4, GR5, GR6 }.

The response of GR3 is { GR2, GR4, GR5, GR6 }.

The response of GR4 is { GR7 }.

The response of GR5 is { GR2, GR3, GR4, GR6 }.

The response of GR6 is { GR2, GR3, GR4, GR5 }.

The description is "Rough and ugly, with dirty clothes and mean, scarred faces. They carry serious-looking swords on their hips, and each has a long knife buckled at the small of his back." Understand "mercenary", "soldiers", "soldier", "rough", "ugly", "dirty", "clothes", "mean", "scarred", "scar", "scars", "face", "faces" as the several mercenaries.

The mercenary-stuff is part of the several mercenaries. Understand "swords", "sword", "knives", "knife", "long", "serious", "serious looking", "buckle", "buckles", "weapon", "weapons", "arms" as the mercenary-stuff. The description is "The weapons look grossly out of place at this fancy ball, but no one else seems to notice[first time]. Maybe they're not noticing on purpose[only]."

Instead of doing something other than examining to the mercenary-stuff, say "You'd have to get close to the mercenaries to do that, and that doesn't seem like a good idea."

Instead of doing something other than examining to the several mercenaries:
	say "It would probably be best if you didn't attract their attention." instead;

Chapter 9 - Scene Ending

Brief Encounter ends when the location is the War Room;

High Society ends when Brief Encounter ends.

Book 13 - The Baron

Confronting the Baron is a scene. Confronting the Baron begins when High Society ends. Confronting the Baron ends when the skirmish begins.

When Confronting the Baron begins:
	select the chapter channel;
	say "Chapter 11 - Baron Fossville";
	select the main channel;
	say "The mercenaries march you out of the ballroom, through the foyer, and into the inner reaches of the keep. At every doorway you pass a pair of Lord's Guards standing at attention; some of them glare at the ill-kempt and ill-disciplined mercenaries, but no one makes a move to stop them or help you. You are keenly aware of the dagger strapped to your leg under your dress, but there seems to be no opportunity to use it. Not that you'd last very long against a half-dozen armed men anyway.[paragraph break]The last door is not guarded. The mercenaries push you through into a room filled with dim, flickering light.";
	move the several mercenaries to the War Room;
	move Pieter to the War Room;
	now Pieter is caught;
	now the knotted ropes are part of Pieter;
	try looking;
	move Baron Fossville to the War Room;
	change the current script to {FOSS0, FOSS1, FOSS2, FOSS3, FOSS4, FOSS5, FOSS6, FOSS7, FOSS8, FOSS9, FOSS10};

Chapter 2 - War Room

Section 1 - Description

The War Room is a room. "[if the skirmish is happening]The room has become a chaos of shouting voices and ringing steel.[otherwise]A fireplace lights this grim chamber with a hellish, red glow. A huge, round table sits in the center of the room. Hanging opposite the fireplace is a vast map of Miradania, covering nearly the entire wall. An iron-reinforced door leads east.[end if]"

Understand "grim", "chamber" as the War Room.

Instead of facing east in the War Room, try examining the heavy iron reinforced door.

Instead of facing a planar direction in the War Room, say "There seems to be no way out of here besides the door."

Section 2 - Scenery (Fireplace)

The fireplace is scenery, in the War Room. The description is "The fire is banked high, flames roaring and popping." Understand "fire", "flames", "hellish", "red", "glow", "high", "banked", "flame", "roaring", "popping", "hearth", "knothole", "knot", "spark", "sparks", "tornado", "light", "firelight" as the fireplace.

Instead of entering, taking or touching the fireplace, say "You'd be burned quite badly."

Every turn when the fireplace is nearby and a random chance of 1 in 10 succeeds:
	say "A knothole explodes in the fire, sending a tornado of sparks up the flue.";

Section 3 - Scenery (Table)

The blackwood table is a supporter, scenery, in the War Room. The description is "The table is polished blackwood. The reflection of the firelight in its ink-dark surface looks like molten lead." Understand "round", "polished", "black", "wood", "wooden", "reflection", "surface", "inky", "dark", "ink dark", "molten" as the blackwood table.

The map of Miradania is scenery, in the War Room. The description of the map is "The map depicts the entire kingdom, from the northern reaches to the Seven Lakes. The cities are marked with semi-precious stones embedded in the map's surface. Aubrimere, the capital, is represented by a ruby the size of your thumb." Understand "Kingdom", "hanging", "entire" as the map. The printed name is "map".

Some map-regions are part of the map of Miradania. The description is "All of the regions of Miradania, including many you've never heard of are represented on the map." Understand "map", "regions", "region", "reaches", "reach", "lakes", "lake", "cities", "city", "aubrimere", "northern", "seven" as the map-regions. The printed name is "regions".

Some precious stones are part of the map of Miradania. The description is "The semi-precious stones are cunningly woven into the hanging." Understand "semi", "precious", "stone", "ruby", "cunning" as the precious stones.

Section 4 - Scenery (Door)

The heavy iron reinforced door is a door. It is east of the War Room. It is closed, locked, openable, and scenery. The description is "The door is [if closed]locked tight. You'll never get out that way[otherwise]open, but blocked by fighting mercenaries and soldiers[end if]."

Instead of opening the heavy iron reinforced door when the noun is closed, try examining the noun.


Section 5 - Scenery (Pieter)

[Again, we use the real live Pieter for this. See his chapter for descriptions etc.]

Every turn when Pieter is nearby and Pieter is caught and a random chance of 1 in 10 succeeds during Confronting the Baron:
	say "Pieter struggles weakly against his bonds."

Every turn when Pieter is nearby and Pieter is caught during the Skirmish:
	say "Pieter [one of]struggles desperately against his bonds[or]strains against the ropes holding him[or]shouts unintelligibly through his gag[at random]."


Section 6 - Scenery (Still more Mercenaries)

[ Rather than create yet another mercenary object here with essentially the same properties as that in the Ballroom, we'll just move the one in the Ballroom here (see When Confronting the Baron Begins, above) and add some location-specific rules. ]

Instead of communicating when the noun is the several mercenaries and the location is the War Room:
	say "The mercenaries ignore you.";

Instead of doing something other than examining to the several mercenaries when the location is the War Room:
	say "[if the Skirmish is not happening]The mercenaries are watching you too closely; you can't make a move against them[otherwise]The fighting is so chaotic, so vicious, that you can't get near enough to anyone to do anything.[end if].";

Section 7 - Baron Fossville

Instead of talking to someone during Confronting the Baron:
	say "[first time]Fossville's black-gloved hand whips out and cracks you across the face. Stars explode in your vision.[paragraph break]'Please be quiet while I am talking,' says the Baron, as calmly as though he were asking you to pass the salt at the dinner table[subsequently]Not feeling too keen on getting hit again, you decide to keep your mouth shut[only].";

Instead of doing something other than taking inventory, waiting, looking or examining during Confronting the Baron:
	say "The Baron makes a gesture, and you hear the creak of leather as the mercenaries loosen their blades in their sheaths. 'Ah, ah... no funny moves, now,' warns the Baron.";

Section 8 - Scripted events

FOSS0 is a scripted event. The display text is "Someone steps out of the shadows and walks over to stand between you and Pieter. The fire throws his shadow across the length of the room, huge and quivering.[paragraph break]'You know, it's funny,' says Baron Fossville, 'when I first began planning this venture, I always assumed that you would be the [i]easiest[r] obstacle to take care of.'"

FOSS1 is a scripted event. The display text is "'Poisoning your father, now [i]that[r] was easy.' The Baron laughs. 'Took a lot of patience. Bit by bit, for weeks and months. So many servants to bribe. But the old fool never suspected a thing. Thought he was only sick until the very end.'[paragraph break]He glares at you, eyes glowing in the fire light. 'Would that I'd been as patient with you.'"

FOSS2 is a scripted event. The display text is "Fossville smiles. 'But all that's done with now. Once I realized that you were being manipulated into making your [i]own[r] play for the throne—' He stops and glances at you. 'You [i]do[r] realize you're being manipulated, don't you? No one [i]really[r] thinks gutter-trash like you has a legitimate claim to the throne, no matter who your father was. Your [']backers['] are just using you as a pawn to further their own political ends. Where was I?' He pauses, scratching his chin. 'Ah, yes. Once I realized what you were up to, I knew you would show up here. And now this tiresome little game is nearly over, but for a few loose ends.'[paragraph break]He holds out his hand. 'The letter, please.'"

FOSS3 is a scripted event. The display text is "'Please let's not draw this out, Jack,' sighs the Baron. 'Your father's letter, proof of your heritage. I know you have it. Give it to me.'"

FOSS4 is a scripted event. The display text is "The Baron rolls his eyes. 'Oh, for the love of — hold her, please?'[paragraph break]The mercenaries seize you and pin your arms behind your back, while the Baron subjects you to a rough and undignified search. 'You bring this on yourself,' he growls, 'always insisting on doing things the hard way... ah-[i]ha![r]' He finds the letter hidden in a fold of your gown and yanks it free.[paragraph break][i]He didn't find the dagger[r], you think. [i]I still have that[r]."

FOSS5 is a scripted event. The display text is "Fossville holds the letter up to the light, shaking his head slightly as he reads the old words. 'Such a nuisance,' he mutters. 'I can hardly believe it was under my nose all these years, and I never found it. Well, let it be a lesson.' And without another word, he walks over to the fireplace and tosses the letter in.[paragraph break]The dry parchment catches instantly, flares up — and it's gone. Your history, your heritage, your one shot at a world beyond the crumbling orphanage and the back alleys of the city — your [i]life[r] — gone in a flash and a swirl of ashes up the chimney. The shock of it hits you like a punch in the gut.[paragraph break]Fossville draws his sword and admires its blade, glowing in the firelight. He smiles as he approaches you, raising his weapon. 'And now there's just one last — eh?' He stops, looks to the door.[paragraph break]You can hear shouting outside, the sound of metal ringing on metal."

FOSS6 is a scripted event. The display text is "Suddenly the door bursts open — a mercenary staggers backwards into the room, crashes into the table — men rush in, shouting, swords flashing —[paragraph break]Your breath catches in your throat.[paragraph break][i]It's Bobby![paragraph break][r]'Jack! Behind me!' he shouts, slamming his fist into a mercenary's face. He flashes you that devil-may-care grin of his before slashing his way into the room, making a beeline for Baron Fossville."

FOSS7 is a scripted event. The display text is "'Give it up, Fossville!' yells Bobby. 'You are guilty of murdering Duke Toresal! Ten of my men heard you confess from outside the door. Your bid for the throne is over!' Fossville brings his own sword up and parries Bobby's cut with a resounding [i]clang[r]. 'Goddesses curse it, I thought I was done with you, spy,' growls the Baron. 'Doesn't anyone stay dead anymore?'[paragraph break]'I'm sure [i]you[r] won't have any trouble,' Bobby snaps."

FOSS8 is a scripted event. The display text is "Fossville counterattacks, slashing brutally at Bobby's face. Bobby falls back, parrying each blow, until his back hits the edge of the table. The Baron roars and brings his sword up for a killing blow, but Bobby jumps up onto the table, rolls over it, and lands on the other side. He's breathing hard — perhaps the Baron is a better swordsman than Bobby had anticipated."

FOSS9 is a scripted event. The display text is "The two swords clash and clash again. Fossville pushes Bobby back, back across the room, this time backing him towards the roaring fireplace. Bobby is a skilled fighter, but he's losing ground before the Baron's fury. Flames lick the edge of his cloak as he staggers back against the mantelpiece.[paragraph break]You have to do something!"

FOSS10 is a scripted event. The display text is "The Baron feints, then strikes Bobby across the face with his pommel. Bobby's sword clatters to the floor and he falls to his knees. Pieter slumps helplessly against his bonds, groaning with dismay.[paragraph break]'It's over, spy,' snarls the Baron as he steps forward, sword raised."

Letter Request is a scene. Letter Request begins when FOSS2 is fired. Letter Request ends when Baron Fossville carries the secret letter.

Instead of giving the secret letter to Baron Fossville during Letter Request:
	now Baron Fossville carries the secret letter;
	remove FOSS3 from the current script, if present;
	remove FOSS4 from the current script, if present;
	say "Bitterly, you hand over the Duke's letter.[paragraph break]'Thank you,' says Fossville. 'You see how much easier things are when you're cooperative?'"

The Skirmish is a scene. The skirmish begins when FOSS6 is fired. The skirmish ends when the number of entries in the current script is 0.

Instead of listening to the fighting, say "The screams and clashing weapons are deafening."

Before going a direction in the War Room during the Skirmish:
	say "The hallway is filled with men fighting, Bobby's reinforcements against the Baron's mercenaries. Both sides are so intent on hacking each other to pieces, you'd never get through.[if Pieter is caught] Besides, you can't leave Pieter tied up![end if]" instead;

Instead of doing something other than talking to or examining to Baron Fossville during the Skirmish:
	say "You try to get close enough to get in a jab with your dagger, but Bobby pushes you back just as the Baron's [one of]backswing[or]slash[or]thrust[or]jab[at random] nearly takes off your [one of]eye[or]ear[or]hand[or]head[at random]. 'No, Jack!' he yells, 'Leave him to me!'"

Instead of talking to Baron Fossville during the Skirmish:
	say "The Baron is so focused on attacking Bobby, he doesn't even hear you."

Instead of communicating when the noun is Bobby during the Skirmish:
	say "So many questions fill your throat that you can't get them out: [i]What are you doing here? Where have you been? How did you survive?[no line break][r]But there's no time to talk, now — Bobby is fighting for his life!"

	remove Pieter from play;
	remove Bobby from play;
	remove Baron Fossville from play;
	say "Working quickly, you saw through the ropes holding Pieter. 'Thank you,' he gasps, rubbing feeling back into his wrists. Then he grabs up the sword of a fallen mercenary and rushes to Bobby's aid.[paragraph break]Bobby and Pieter fight side by side, attacking one after the other so that the Baron has no chance to counter. He falls back before their onslaught, stumbles... and then he turns and runs out the door, calling for his mercenaries to defend him.[paragraph break]With a shout, Pieter gives chase. Bobby turns to you, grinning. 'Wait for me here, Jack,' he says. 'We'll catch that villain quick enough, and then I'll explain everything.' And then with a bound, he is gone.";
	update the character list;

Some knotted ropes are scenery in the War Room. The printed name is "ropes".

	say "At that moment, there is a sudden [i]crack[r] and a rumbling, and a cold draft rushes into the room, tugging at the flames in the fireplace and throwing the room into wildly pitching shadow.[paragraph break]Behind you, the map wall has opened to reveal a dark, cavernous passageway, and [i]more[r] men are rushing out — men dressed all in black, with dark hoods and scarves hiding their faces.[paragraph break]'That's her! Get her!' cries a voice. A young woman's voice. A voice you've heard before.[paragraph break]It happens so fast. Hands are on you, lifting you off your feet, wresting the dagger from your grasp, pulling you back into that dark, dark tunnel. The firelight falls away, shrinks down to a flickering, orange rectangle. The rumbling starts again, and the rectangle grows narrower, narrower...[paragraph break]'Don't worry,' says the voice. 'We're not going to, like, [i]hurt[r] you.'[paragraph break]And then everything is black.";
	End the game saying "The End".
