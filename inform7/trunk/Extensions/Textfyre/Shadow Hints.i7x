		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]1[quotation mark]>It wouldn't be a good idea to be found in here.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]2[quotation mark]>But there's no way to get away through the door, or the window.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]3[quotation mark]>You'd better hide somewhere.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]4[quotation mark]>The cot's too small. There's only thing big enough...</hint>";

		say "			<topic title=[quotation mark]Why is everyone here so interested in clocks?[quotation mark]>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]1[quotation mark]>In the world of Klockwerk, clocks - and clockwork mechanisms - are the most important things in the world. More important even than people.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]2[quotation mark]>That's what makes the world of Klockwerk an interesting place to be - but sometimes, it can also be a dangerous and unfriendly place.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]3[quotation mark]>As Wren is going to find out...</hint>";
		say "			</topic>";
		say "			<topic title=[quotation mark]This is frustrating - I can't hear what they're saying![quotation mark]>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]1[quotation mark]>The Abbot is just visible through that keyhole. Maybe you could hear something there?</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]2[quotation mark]>But maybe listening at the keyhole still isn't enough. If there was something you had that could make it louder...</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]3[quotation mark]>There's an old trick to listening at keyholes: using something cup-shaped to amplify the sound...</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]4[quotation mark]>Try putting your glass against the keyhole.</hint>";
		say "			</topic>";
		say "			<topic title=[quotation mark]They've gone. What should I do?[quotation mark]>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]1[quotation mark]>Sounds like you need to tell someone what you've heard.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]2[quotation mark]>Get out of the clock and get out of the Abbot's room, before he comes back!</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]3[quotation mark]>The door is to the west - just type WEST to go that way.</hint>";

		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]1[quotation mark]>The Abbey can be a big and confusing place, with lots of rooms.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]2[quotation mark]>However, you should soon start to get your bearings. There's a long central hall, and other rooms coming off it.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]3[quotation mark]>In particular, at the end of the hall is the yard - and that leads onto the Cathderal...</hint>";

		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]2[quotation mark]>Right now you're in the Abbey of Time, so you'd better leave.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]3[quotation mark]>Once you're in the Hall of the Abbey, you need to keep going southwest until you get out.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]4[quotation mark]>Except there's a spanner in the works, and that's Calvin.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]5[quotation mark]>Either you need to find another way out of the Abbey, or some way of shifting him.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]6[quotation mark]>Time to explore - and you might find Brother Horloge of some interest... </hint>";
		say "			</topic>";
		say "			<topic title=[quotation mark]Help! I keep getting caught by Drake[quotation mark]>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]1[quotation mark]>Drake is a big pain in your life, Wren. He's the worst there is.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]2[quotation mark]>But luckily, he's boring. Everything he does is clockwork. He likes to stick to a pattern.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]3[quotation mark]>If you can work out which order he walks around the Abbey in, you might be able to dodge him.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]4[quotation mark]>Also, if he's approaching a room where you're standing, you might be able to hide.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]5[quotation mark]>Several of the rooms offer hiding places.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]6[quotation mark]>Try hiding under the Refectory tables - or in the Pantry in the Kitchen!</hint>";
		say "			</topic>";
		say "			<topic title=[quotation mark]I've seen some keys but I can't get my hands on them![quotation mark]>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]1[quotation mark]>Of course you can't, they're not yours!</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]2[quotation mark]>But you could probably borrow them.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]3[quotation mark]>Except Brother Horloge won't let you. Every time you try and take the keys it's too distracting for him. Perhaps you could distract him in return.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]4[quotation mark]>There seems to be something he wants. Can you figure out what it is?</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]5[quotation mark]>Brother Horloge is a great drinker of tea. Time to brew up a cup!</hint>";

		say "			<topic title=[quotation mark]I can't make the machine in the Kitchen work![quotation mark]>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]1[quotation mark]>Like all good clockwork machines, the Tea Maker needs a lot of different things to make it go.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]2[quotation mark]>Make sure you EXAMINE it closely. Try pulling the lever to turn it on.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]3[quotation mark]>Some of the things you need are obvious. You can't make tea without tea leaves, or a cup.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]4[quotation mark]>When you've found some tea, put it in the basket. When you've found a cup, put that in the bracket.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]5[quotation mark]>You'll have to fill the kettle up too.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]6[quotation mark]>But what about this missing gear?</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]7[quotation mark]>Have you seen anywhere which might stock replacement gears?</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]8[quotation mark]>Perhaps Brother Reloh can help? (Or, perhaps not).</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]9[quotation mark]>Take one of the new gears from the Cabinet in the Scriptorium. Then put that into the Tea Machine.</hint>";

		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]1[quotation mark]>Most of the monks are very busy. And very crotchety.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]2[quotation mark]>Some of them will talk to you - the Abbot, for instance, if you're brave enough to go back to his quarters.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]3[quotation mark]>Try asking him about something, like clockwork, or the Abbey, or even - gulp! - the Figure in Grey...</hint>";
		say "			</topic>";
		say "			<topic title=[quotation mark]I've got these keys, what are they for?[quotation mark]>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]1[quotation mark]>Have you found anything you could unlock?</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]2[quotation mark]>There are two things the keys will open for you.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]3[quotation mark]>Both are in the same room...</hint>";

		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]2[quotation mark]>...if you're brave enough, but once you start messing with clocks, there's no turning them back!</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]3[quotation mark]>(Well, there is... but metaphorically there isn't. Never mind.)</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]4[quotation mark]>If you're going to reset the clock, you'd better choose a sensible time. A time that will cause Calvin to leave his post, maybe!</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]5[quotation mark]>Perhaps dinner time would be a good choice? Try setting the clock to that.</hint>";
		say "			</topic>";
		say "			<topic title=[quotation mark]What can I do in the garden?[quotation mark]>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]1[quotation mark]>That metal hood looks interesting. There might be something underneath it, if you can figure out how the garden works.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]2[quotation mark]>Otherwise, the walls look interesting too. Might be a way out of the Abbey if you can get over them.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]3[quotation mark]>Have you seen anything that might help you get over a wall?</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]4[quotation mark]>This one's up to you - but don't worry, if you can't solve it, you can still get out of the Abbey a different way!</hint>";

		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]4[quotation mark]>Have you noticed the Great Seals on the floor of the Cathedral?</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]5[quotation mark]>You can guess the Creed as many times as you like. If you get close, Doric will give you some hints.</hint>";
		say "				<hint id=[quotation mark]6[quotation mark]>If you're totally stuck, try just telling him the three items on the Seals.</hint>";
